[SHINING ][LIKE ][A BEACON]
[THRU ][THE ][DARKEST ][NIGHT]
[YOU'RE ][THE ][ONLY ][LIGHT]
[THAT ][LEADS ][ME ][HOME]
[HOME ][IS ][WHERE]
[THE ][FIRE ][BURNS]
[SO ][WARM ][AND ][BRIGHT]
[LONG ][AS ][I HAVE ][YOU]
[I'LL ][NEVER ][ROAM]
[OUR ][PATHS ][MAY ][WANDER]
[ON ][THIS ][WALK ][OF ][LIFE]
[BUT ][I WON'T ][WALK ][ALONE]
[LIKE ][A BLAZE ][OF ][GOLD]
[AT ][THE ][BREAK ][OF ][DAWN]
[YOU'RE ][THE ][POWER]
[THAT ][HEALS ][MY ][SOUL]
[WHEN ][THE ][WIND]
[GROWS ][COLD]
[AND ][I'M ][HALFWAY ][GONE]
[YOU'RE ][THE ][POWER]
[THAT ][KEEPS ][ME ][WHOLE]
[RUNNING ][LIKE ][A RIVER]
[TO ][THE ][ROLLING ][SEA]
[THE ][WATERS]
[OF ][YOUR ][LOVE]
[ARE ][DEEP ][AND ][STRONG]
[MY ][HARBOR]
[AND ][MY ][SHELTER]
[YOU ][WILL ][ALWAYS ][BE]
[EVEN ][WHEN]
[THE ][STORM ][BLOWS]
[HARD ][AND ][STRONG]
[WHILE ][YOUR ][SPIRIT]
[IS ][A PART ][OF ][ME]
[IT ][GIVES ][LIFE]
[TO ][THIS ][SONG]
[LIKE ][A BLAZE ][OF ][GOLD]
[AT ][THE ][BREAK ][OF ][DAWN]
[YOU'RE ][THE ][POWER]
[THAT ][HEALS ][MY ][SOUL]
[WHEN ][THE ][WIND]
[GROWS ][COLD]
[AND ][I'M ][HALFWAY ][GONE]
[YOU'RE ][THE ][POWER]
[THAT ][KEEPS ][ME ][WHOLE]
[WHEN ][THE ][WIND]
[GROWS ][COLD]
[AND ][I'M ][HALFWAY ][GONE]
[YOU'RE ][THE ][POWER]
[THAT ][KEEPS ][ME ][WHOLE]
[YOU'RE ][THE ][POWER]
[THAT ][HEALS ][MY ][SOUL]
[YOU'RE ][THE ][POWER]
[THAT ][KEEPS ][ME ][WHOLE]
