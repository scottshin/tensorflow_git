[I HELD ][HER ][CLOSE]
[TO ][ME]
['CAUSE ][I KNOW]
[SHE ][BREAKS]
[SO ][EASILY]
[AND ][THEN]
[I TOLD ][HER]
[BUT ][I KNEW]
[NO ][MATTER]
[HOW ][I TRIED]
[TO ][CONSOLE ][HER]
[SHE'D ][JUST]
[DO ][THE ][BEST]
[SHE ][COULD]
[BUT ][THERE ][ARE ][TIMES]
[THE ][BEST]
[IS ][NO ][DAMN ][GOOD]
[AND ][NO ][MATTER]
[HOW ][YOU ][TRY]
[TO ][BE ][KIND]
[THERE'S ][ALWAYS]
[STILL ][A PART ][OF ][YOU]
[YOU ][LEAVE ][BEHIND]
[WHEN ][IT ][FALLS ][APART]
[THERE'S ][NO ][EASY ][WAY]
[TO ][BREAK]
[SOMEBODY'S ][HEART]
[I LIED]
[AND ][TOLD ][HER ][SHE'D]
[BE ][FINE]
[THOUGH ][WE ][BOTH]
[KNEW ][IT ][WAS ][JUST]
[A LINE]
[I'D ][HAD ][TO ][DO ][IT]
['CAUSE ][I'D ][A SAID]
[ANYTHING ][TO ][HELP ][ME]
[GET ][THROUGH ][IT]
[THEN ][SHE ][REACHED ][OUT]
[FOR ][MY ][HAND]
[AND ][HER ][SIMPLE ][TOUCH]
[WAS ][MORE]
[THAN ][I COULD ][STAND]
[AND ][I HAD ][TO]
[TURN ][AWAY]
['CAUSE ][I KNEW]
[ALL ][THE ][HURT ][THAT ][SHE]
[WAS ][FEELING]
[I WAS ][FEELING ][TOO]
['CAUSE ][WHEN ][IT]
[FALLS ][APART]
[THERE'S ][NO ][EASY ][WAY]
[TO ][BREAK]
[SOMEBODY'S ][HEART]
[SHE ][COULD'VE]
[GOTTEN ][ANGRY]
[AND ][MADE ][ME ][FEEL]
[LIKE ][A GUILTY ][CHILD]
[BUT ][I REALIZED]
[THAT ][NEVER]
[WAS ][HER ][STYLE]
[I WANTED ][HER]
[TO ][HURT ][ME]
[AND ][NOT ][TREAT ][ME]
[LIKE ][A FRIEND]
[I WANTED ][HER ][TO ][SAY]
[THERE'D ][BE ][SOMEDAY]
[I'D ][COME ][CRAWLIN']
[ON ][MY ][KNEES]
[TO ][ASK ][HER ][BACK ][AGAIN]
[BUT ][SHE ][ACTED]
[LIKE ][A LADY]
[TILL ][THE ][END]
[OH ][WHAT ][A LADY]
[I THOUGHT ][THAT ][SHE'D]
[BREAK ][DOWN]
[BUT ][SHE ][SMILED ][AT ][ME]
[AND ][NEVER ][MADE]
[A SOUND]
[AND ][I GUESS]
[SHE ][UNDERSTOOD]
[IN ][HER ][WAY]
['CAUSE ][HER ][SILENCE]
[TOLD ][ME ][EV'RYTHING]
[SHE ][COULD ][NOT ][SAY]
[WHEN ][IT ][FALLS ][APART]
[OH ][THERE'S ][JUST]
[NO ][EASY ][WAY]
[THERE'S ][JUST]
[NO ][EASY ][WAY]
[THERE'S ][NO ][EASY ][WAY]
[TO ][BREAK]
[SOMEBODY'S ][HEART]
