DON'T KNOW WHY



NORAH JONES

[I WAITED ]['TIL]
[I SAW ][THE ][SUN]
[I DON'T ][KNOW ][WHY]
[I DIDN'T ][COME]
[I LEFT ][YOU ][BY]
[THE ][HOUSE ][OF ][FUN]
[I DON'T ][KNOW ][WHY]
[I DIDN'T ][COME]
[I DON'T ][KNOW ][WHY]
[I DIDN'T ][COME]
[WHEN ][I SAW]
[THE ][BREAK ][OF ][DAY]
[I WISHED ][THAT]
[I COULD ][FLY ][AWAY]
[INSTEAD ][OF ][KNEELING]
[IN ][THE ][SAND]
[CATCHING ][TEARDROPS]
[IN ][MY ][HAND]
[MY ][HEART ][IS]
[DRENCHED ][IN ][WINE]
[BUT ][YOU'LL ][BE]
[ON ][MY ][MIND]
[FOREVER]
[OUT ][ACROSS]
[THE ][ENDLESS ][SEA]
[I WOULD ][DIE ][IN ][ECSTASY]
[BUT ][I'LL ][BE]
[A BAG ][OF ][BONES]
[DRIVING ][DOWN]
[THE ][ROAD ][ALONE]
[MY ][HEART ][IS]
[DRENCHED ][IN ][WINE]
[BUT ][YOU'LL ][BE]
[ON ][MY ][MIND]
[FOREVER]
[SOMETHING ][HAS]
[TO ][MAKE ][YOU ][RUN]
[I DON'T ][KNOW ][WHY]
[I DIDN'T ][COME]
[I FEEL ][AS ][EMPTY]
[AS ][A DRUM]
[I DON'T ][KNOW ][WHY]
[I DIDN'T ][COME]
[I DON'T ][KNOW ][WHY]
[I DIDN'T ][COME]
[I DON'T ][KNOW ][WHY]
[I DIDN'T ][COME]
