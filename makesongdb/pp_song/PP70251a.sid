[What ][so ][ever]
[solves ][the ][love]
[And ][some ][things]
[come ][between ][us]
[To ][turn ][the ][fire ][cold]
[What's ][that ][chase ][you]
[in ][the ][night]
[And ][suddenly]
[they ][stole]
[the ][light ][from]
[in ][your ][eyes]
[Now ][we've ][remained]
[to ][be ][alone]
[no ][matter ][who ][may ][try]
[to ][take ][your ][place]
[And ][I'll ][remember ][you]
[The ][dreams]
[we ][couldn't ][dream]
[The ][tears]
[I ][should ][have ][seen]
[We ][used ][to ][say]
[forever]
[But ][I'll ][remember ][you]
[You ][pure]
[and ][simple ][heart]
[And ][shadows]
[in ][the ][dark]
[I ][will ][always]
[love ][you]
[I'll ][remember ][you]
[Say ][merry]
[to ][fallen ][snow]
[We ][know ][that]
[it ][will ][last]
[But ][there's ][no ][way]
[to ][know]
[It's ][as ][still ][as]
[the ][sea ][and ][sky]
[Quietly ][in ][fact]
[quietly ][I ][cry]
[Here ][I ][stand ][alone]
[with ][every ][promise]
[But ][they ][took]
[my ][hands]
[Oh ][no ][no]
[I'll ][remember ][you]
[Dreams]
[we ][couldn't ][dream]
[The ][tears]
[I ][should've ][seen]
[We ][used ][to ][say]
[forever]
[I'll ][remember ][you]
[dreams]
[we ][couldn't ][dream]
[The ][tears]
[I ][should've ][seen]
[We ][used ][to ][say]
[forever]
[I'll ][remember ][you]
[Oh ][and ][I ][remain ][alone]
[no ][matter ][who ][may ][try]
[to ][take ][your ][place]
[O ][ho ][ho ][ho ][baby]
[I'll ][remember ][you]
[The ][dreams]
[we ][couldn't ][dream]
[The ][tears]
[I ][should've ][seen]
[We ][used ][to ][say]
[forever]
[I'll ][remember ][you]
[The ][dreams]
