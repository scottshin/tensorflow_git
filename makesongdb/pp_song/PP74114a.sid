[I SEE ][THE ][SUNLIGHT]
[IN ][HER ][HAIR]
[I FEEL]
[THE ][WARM ][SMILE]
[THAT ][SHE ][WEARS]
[SHE ][HAS ][NO ][RECIPE]
[FOR ][LOVE]
[AND ][I JUST ][CAN'T]
[GET ][ENOUGH]
[FROM ][THE ][DISTANCE]
[OF ][MY ][MIND]
[THE ][CLOCK]
[THAT'S ][RINGING]
[SAYS ][IT'S ][TIME]
[TO ][WAKE ][UP]
[TO ][MY ][DESTINY]
[IT'S ][TIME ][TO]
[FACE ][REALITY]
[IT'S ][ONLY ][LOVE]
[THAT ][I FEEL ][INSIDE]
[BUT ][I'LL ][GET ][BY]
[SOMEHOW]
[IT'S ][ONLY ][LOVE]
[I KNOW ][THERE'S]
[SOMETHING ][ELSE]
[FOR ][ME ][GIRL]
[I TELL ][MYSELF]
[THAT ][IT'S ][NOT ][REAL]
[THERE'S ][NOTHING ][LEFT]
[FOR ][ME ][TO ][FEEL]
[I'LL ][JUST ][BE ][GOING]
[ON ][MY ][WAY]
[TOMORROW ][BRINGS]
[ANOTHER ][DAY]
[IT'S ][ONLY ][LOVE]
[THAT ][I FEEL ][INSIDE]
[BUT ][I'VE]
[GOT ][TO ][BE ][STRONG]
[IT'S ][ONLY ][LOVE]
