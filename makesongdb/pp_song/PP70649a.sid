[So ][I'm ][down]
[and ][so ][I'm ][out,]
[but ][so ][are]
[many ][others]
[So ][I ][feel ][like]
[try'n' ][to ][hide]
[my ][head ]['neath]
[these ][covers]
[Life ][is ][like ][the]
[seasons]
[After ][winter ][comes]
[the ][spring]
[So ][I'll ][keep ][this]
[smile ][a ][while]
[and ][see ][what]
[tomorrow ][brings]
[I've ][been ][told]
[and ][I ][believe]
[that ][life ][is]
[meant ][for ][livin']
[and ][even ][when ][my]
[chips ][are ][low,]
[there's ][still]
[some ][left]
[for ][givin']
[I've ][been ][many ][places]
[maybe ][not]
[as ][far ][as ][you]
[So ][I ][think]
[I'll ][stay ][a ][while]
[and ][see ][if ][some]
[dreams ][come ][true]
[There ][isn't ][much]
[that ][I ][have ][learned]
[through ][my]
[foolish ][years]
[except ][that ][life ][keeps]
[runnin' ][in ][cycles]
[First ][there's ][laughter]
[then ][those ][tears]
[~~~]
[But ][I'll ][keep]
[my ][head ][up ][high]
[although ][I'm]
[kind ][of ][tired]
[My ][gal ][just ][up]
[and ][left ][last ][week]
[Friday ][I ][got ][fired]
[You ][know ][it's]
[almost ][funny]
[but ][things ][can't]
[get ][worse ][than ][now]
[So ][I'll ][keep ][on]
[tryin' ][to ][sing]
[but ][please]
[don't ][ask ][me ][now]
[~~~]
