[There ][was ][a ][time,]
[I ][was ][everything]
[and ][nothing]
[all ][in ][one]
[When ][you ][found ][me]
[I ][was ][feelin']
[like ][a]
[cloud ][across ][the ][sun]
[Oh, ][I ][need ][to ][tell]
[ya, ][how ][to ][light ][up]
[every]
[second ][of ][the ][day]
[But ][in ][the ][moonlight]
[you ][just ][shine ][like]
[a ][beacon ][on ][the ][bay]
[And ][I ][can't ][explain]
[But ][there's]
[something ][about]
[the ][way ][you]
[look ][tonight]
[Takes ][my ][breath ][away]
[It's ][that]
[feelin' ][I ][get]
[about ][you]
[deep ][inside]
[An' ][I ][can't ][describe]
[Oh, ][there's]
[something ][about]
[the ][way ][you]
[look ][tonight]
[Takes ][my ][breath ][away]
[The ][way ][you]
[look ][tonight]
[With ][a ][smile ][you]
[pull ][the ][deepest]
[secrets ][from]
[my ][heart]
[In ][all ][honesty,]
[I'm ][speechless]
[an' ][I ][don't]
[know ][where ][to ][start]
[And ][I ][can't ][explain]
[But ][there's]
[something ][about]
[the ][way ][you]
[look ][tonight]
[Takes ][my ][breath ][away]
[It's ][that]
[feelin' ][I ][get]
[about ][you]
[deep ][inside]
[An' ][I ][can't ][describe]
[Oh, ][there's]
[something ][about]
[the ][way ][you]
[look ][tonight]
[Takes ][my ][breath ][away]
[The ][way ][you]
[look ][tonight]
[The ][way ][you]
[look ][tonight]
[The ][way ][you]
[look ][tonight]
[The ][way ][you]
[look ][tonight]
[The ][way ][you]
[look ][tonight]
[The ][way ][you]
[look ][tonight]
[The ][way ][you]
[look ][tonight]
[The ][way ][you]
[look ][tonight]
[The ][way ][you]
