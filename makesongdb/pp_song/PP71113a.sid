LIFTED



LIGHTHOUSE FAMILY

[I ][really]
[love ][to ][be ][alone]
[without ][all]
[the ][ache ][and ][pain]
[and ][the]
[April ][showers]
[But ][it ][ain't ][long]
[before ][I]
[long ][for ][you]
[Like ][a ][ray ][of ][hope]
[coming]
[through ][the ][blue]
[When ][it ][all]
[gets ][darker]
[Then ][the ][whole]
[thing ][falls ][apart]
[I ][guess ][it]
[doesn't ][really]
[matter ]['bout]
[the ][rain]
['Cause ][we'll ][get]
[through ][it ][anyway]
[We'll ][get ][up]
[and ][start ][again]
['Cause ][we]
[could ][be ][lifted]
[Lifted, ][lifted]
[We ][could ][be]
[lifted ][from]
[the ][shadow]
[Lifted]
[Oh, ][oh ][we ][could]
[be ][lifted ][up ][today]
[Lifted ][all ][the ][way]
[You ][and ][I]
[forever ][baby]
[Lifted,]
[lifted, ][lifted]
[Hey, ][yeah ][yeah]
[It's ][undisturbable]
[The ][peace]
[we've ][found]
[in ][a ][bright]
[blue ][space]
[up ][above ][the ][cloud]
[But ][everything]
[is ][understandable]
[You ][don't ][have ][to]
[say ][anything]
[too ][loud]
[Then ][our ][love]
[runs ][out ][again]
[Walk ][back ][down]
[to ][solid ][ground]
[I ][wouldn't ][say ][I'm]
[mad ][about ][the ][rain]
[But ][we'll ][get]
[through ][it ][anyway]
[We'll ][get ][back]
[to ][the ][start ][again]
['Cause ][we]
[could ][be ][lifted]
[Lifted, ][lifted]
[We ][could ][be]
[lifted ][from]
[the ][shadow]
[Lifted]
[Oh, ][oh ][we ][could]
[be ][lifted ][up ][today]
[Lifted ][all ][the ][way]
[You ][and ][I]
[forever ][baby]
[Lifted, ][whoa ][we]
[could ][be ][lifted]
[We ][could ][be ][lifted]
[Hey, ][yeah ][yeah]
[We ][could]
[be ][we]
[could ][be]
[We ][could ][be]
[you ][and ][I ][forever]
[We ][could]
[be ][we ][could ][be]
[Yeah ][we ][could ][be]
[We ][could ][be ][lifted]
[up ][to ][new ][horizons]
[Lifted]
[We ][could ][be ][lifted]
[We ][could ][be ][lifted]
[We ][could ][be]
[lifted ][from]
[the ][shadows, ][Lifted]
[And ][when ][it ][all]
[gets ][on ][top ][again]
[It ][doesn't ][really]
[matter ]['bout]
[the ][rain]
[Lifted]
[And ][when ][it ][all]
[gets ][on ][top ][again]
[It ][doesn't ][really]
[matter ]['bout]
[the ][rain]
[Lifted]
