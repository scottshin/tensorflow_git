Kenny Rogers

[Look ][at ][this ][face ][I know]
[the ][years ][are ][showin']
[Look ][at]
[this ][life]
[I still ][don't ][know]
[where ][it's ][goin']
[I don't ][know ][much ][but]
[I know ][how ][to ][love ][you]
[And ][that ][maybe]
[all ][I need ][to ][know]
[Look ][at ][these ][eyes ][they]
[never ][seem ][to ][matter]
[Look ][at ][these ][dreams]
[so ][beat ][and]
[so ][battered]
[I don't ][know ][much ][but]
[I know ][how ][to ][love ][you]
[And ][that ][maybe]
[all ][I need ][to ][know]
[So ][many ][questions]
[still ][left ][unanswered]
[So ][much ][I've ][never]
[broken ][through]
[And ][what ][I feel]
[in ][me ][here]
[Sometimes ][I see]
[so ][clearly]
[The ][only ][trouble ][I've]
[ever ][known ][is ][me ][and ][you]
[Look ][at ][this ][man ][so]
[blessed ][with]
[inspiration]
[Look ][at ][this ][soul ][still]
[searching ][for]
[salvation]
[I don't ][know ][much ][but]
[I know ][how ][to ][love ][you]
[And ][that ][may ][be]
[all ][I need ][to ][know]
[I don't ][know ][much ][but]
[I know ][how ][to ][love ][you]
[And ][that ][may ][be]
[all ][I need ][to ][know]
[I don't ][know ][much ][but]
[I know ][how ][to ][love ][you]
[And ][that ][may ][be ][all]
[there ][is ][to ][know]
