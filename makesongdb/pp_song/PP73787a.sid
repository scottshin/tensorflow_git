[TONIGHT ][I TOLD ][ALL]
[MY ][FRIENDS ][GOOD ][BYE]
[AND ][I WALKED ][AWAY]
[SO ][THEY ][WOULDN'T]
[SEE ][ME ][CRY]
[AND ][HEAD]
[FOR ][SWINGIN' ][DOORS]
[AS ][FAST]
[AS ][I CAN]
[FOR ][WHAT ][LOVE]
[HAS ][DONE ][TO ][ME]
[SHOULDN'T ][HAPPEN]
[TO ][A MAN]
[AND ][NOW ][I]
[FIND ][MYSELF]
[SITTIN' ][HERE ][WITH ][YOU]
[AND ][YOU ][MAKE]
[ME ][WONDER]
[WHY ][I EVER ][FELT ][BLUE]
[YOU'VE ][SHOWN]
[UNDERSTANDING]
[THAT ][FEW ][PEOPLE ][KNOW]
[AND ][NOW ][THAT]
[I'VE ][FOUND ][YOU]
[I'LL ][NEVER ][LET ][GO]
[ALREADY ][IT'S ][HEAVEN]
[AND ][WE'VE ][BARELY ][MET]
[AND ][YOU'VE ][NOT]
[EVEN ][STARTED]
[LOVIN' ][ME ][YET]
['CAUSE ][YOU'VE]
[MADE ][IT ][SWEETER]
[THAN ][IT'S ][EVER ][BEEN]
[AND ][IF ][YOU]
[SHOULD ][LOVE ][ME]
[WHAT ][WOULD ][IT ][BE ][THEN?]
[ALREADY ][IT'S ][HEAVEN]
[THE ][LONG ][SEARCH]
[IS ][THROUGH]
[AND ][IT'S ][SO ][GOOD]
[TO ][KNOW ][NOW]
[THAT ][HEAVEN ][IS ][YOU]
