[I ][remember ][daddy's]
[hands ][folded ][silently]
[in ][prayer ][and]
[reaching ][out ][to ][hold]
[me ][when ][I ][had ][a ][night]
[mare]
[You ][could ][read ][quite]
[a ][story ][in ][the]
[callouses ][and ][lines]
[Years ][of ][work ][and]
[worry ][had ][left ][there]
[mark ][behind]
[I ][remember ][daddy's]
[hands ][how ][they ][held]
[my ][mama ][tight]
[and ][patted ][my ][back]
[for ][something ][done]

[There ][are ][things ][that]
[I've ][forgotten ][that ][I]

[But ][I'll ][always]
[remember ][the ][love ][in]
[daddy's ][hands]
[Daddy's ][hands ][were]
[soft ][and ][kind ][when ][I]
[was ][crying]
[Daddy's ][hands ][were]
[hard ][as ][steel ][when]
[I'd ][done ][wrong]
[Daddy's ][hands ][weren't]
[always ][gentle ][but]
[I've ][come ][to]
[understand ][there ][was]
[always ][love ][in]
[daddy's ][hands]
[I ][remember ][daddy's]
[hands ][working ]['til]
[they ][bled ][sacrificed]
[unselfishly ][just ][to]
[keep ][us ][all ][fed]
[If ][I ][could ][do ][things]
[over ][I'd ][live ][my]
[life ][again ][and ][never]
[take ][for ][granted ][the]
[love ][in ][daddy's ][hands]
[Daddy's ][hands ][were]
[soft ][and ][kind ][when ][I]
