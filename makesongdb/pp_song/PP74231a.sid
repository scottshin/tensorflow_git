[I was ][down ][my ][dreams]
[were ][wearing ][thin]
[When ][you're ][lost,]
[where ][do ][you ][begin]
[My ][heart ][always]
[seemed ][to ][drift]
[from ][day ][to ][day]

[Then ][you ][smiled]
[and ][I reached]
[out ][to ][you]

[would ][be]
[Two ][less ][lonely ][people]
[in ][the ][world]
[and ][it's ][gonna ][be ][fine]
[Out ][of ][all ][the]
[people ][in ][the ][world]
[I just ][can't]
[believe ][your ][mine]
[In ][my ][life]
[where ][everything]
[was ][wrong]
[Something ][finally]
[went ][right]
[Now ][there's ][two]
[less ][lonely ][people]
[in ][the ][world ][tonight]
[Just ][to ][think]
[what ][I might]
[have ][missed]
[Looking ][back ][how]
