[Living ][on ][the ][road,]
[my ][friend]
[was ][gonna ][keep]
[you ][free ][and ][clean;]
[and ][now ][you ][wear]
[your ][skin ][like ][iron]
[and ][your ][breath]
[as ][hard ][as ][kerosene]
[Weren't ][you]
[mama's ][only ][boy?]
[But ][her ][fav'rite ][one,]
[it ][seemed]
[She ][began ][to ][cry]
[when ][you ][said ][goodbye]
[sank ][into ][your ][dream]
[Poncho ][was ][a]
[bandit ][boy;]
[his ][horse ][was ][fast]
[as ][polished ][steel]
[He ][wore ][his ][gun]
[outside ][his ][pants]
[for ][all ][the]
[honest ][world ][to ][feel]
[Well, ][Poncho ][met]
[his ][match, ][you ][know]
[on ][the ][deserts]
[down ][in ][Mexico]
[And ][nobody]
[heard ][his ][dying ][word]
[ah, ][but ][that's]
[the ][way ][it ][goes]
[All ][the]
["Federales" ][say]
[they ][could ][have]
[had ][him ][any ][day]
[They ][only ][let]
[him ][slip ][away]
[out ][of ][kindness,]
[I ][suppose]
[Lefty, ][he ][can't]
[sing ][the ][blues]
[all ][night ][long]
[like ][he ][used ][to]
[The ][dust ][that]
[Poncho ][bit ][down ][south]
[ended ][up ][in]
[Lefty's ][mouth]
[The ][day ][they]
[laid ][poor ][Poncho ][low]
[Lefty ][split ][for ][Ohio;]
[where ][he ][got]
[the ][bread ][to ][go]
[there ][ain't]
[nobody ][know]
[All ][the]
["Federales" ][say]
[they ][could ][have]
[had ][him ][any ][day]
[We ][only ][let]
[him ][slip ][away]
[out ][of ][kindness,]
[I ][suppose]
[The ][poets ][tell]
[how ][Poncho ][felt]
[and ][Lefty's]
[living ][in ][a]
[cheap ][hotel]
[The ][desert's ][quiet,]
[Cleveland's ][cold]
[and ][so ][the ][story]
[ends, ][we're ][told]
[Poncho ][needs ][your]
[prayers, ][it's ][true]
[and ][save ][a ][few]
[for ][Lefty ][too]
[He ][only ][did]
[what ][he ][had ][to ][do]
[and ][now ][he's]
[growing ][old]
[All ][the]
["Federales" ][say]
[they ][could ][have]
[had ][him ][any ][day]
[We ][only ][let]
[him ][go ][so ][long]
[out ][of ][kindness,]
[I ][suppose]
[A ][few ][gray]
["Federales" ][say]
[they ][could ][have]
[had ][him ][any ][day]
[We ][only ][let]
[him ][go ][so ][long]
[out ][of ][kindness,]
[I ][suppose]
