If I ruled the world

[If ][I ][ruled ][the ][world]
[every ][day ][would]
[be ][the ][first ][day]
[of ][spring]
[every ][heart]
[would ][have ][a ][new]
[song ][to ][sing]
[we'd ][sing ][of ][the ][joy]
[every ][morning]
[would ][bring]
[If ][I ][ruled ][the ][world]
[every ][man ][would]
[be ][as ][free ][as ][a ][bird]
[every ][voice ][would]
[be ][a ][voice]
[to ][be ][heard]
[and ][on ][my ][word]
[we ][would ][treasure]
[each ][day]
[that ][occured]
[my ][world ][would ][be]
[a ][beautiful ][place]
[where ][we ][would]
[weave ][such]
[wounderful ][dreams]
[my ][world ][would ][wear]
[a ][smile ][on ][its ][face]
[like ][the ][man]
[in ][the ][moon ][has]
[when ][the ][moon ][beams]
[If ][I ][ruled ][the ][world]
[every ][man ][would]
[say ][the ][world ][was]
[his ][friend]
[there'd ][be]
[happiness ][that ][no]
[man ][could ][end]
[no ][my ][friend]
[not ][if ][I ][ruled]
[the ][world]
[every ][head ][would]
[be ][held ][up ][high]
[there'd ][be ][sunshine]
[in ][everyone's ][sky]
[if ][the ][day ][ever]
[dawned ][when ][I]
[ruled ][the ][world]
