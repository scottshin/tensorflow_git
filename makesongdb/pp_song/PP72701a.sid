[REMEMBER]
[HOW ][WE ][STARTED]
[ON ][A ][SUMMER'S ][NIGHT]
[TOO ][DRUNK ][TO ][CARE]
[ABOUT ][WHAT ][MIGHT]
[YOU ][TURNED ][MY ][HEAD]
[TO ][KISS ][YOUR ][LIPS]
[TIME ][STOOD ][STILL ][AS]
[MY ][HEART ][SKIPPED]
[A ][BEAT]
[AND ][IF ][I ][COULD ][I'D]
[TAKE ][YOUR ][HAND]
[AND ][LEAD ][YOU ][OFF]
[BACK ][TO ][THE ][PAST]
[I ][KNOW ][A ][TRAIL]
[A ][SECRET ][MILE]
[AND ][BETTER ][TO ][CRY]
[THAN ][NEVER ][SMILE]
[THE ][MOONLIGHT ][SHINING]
[THROUGH ][YOUR]
[FLOWERED ][CURTAINS]
[I ][THINK ][WE ][KNEW ][IT]
[WAS ][US ][FOR ][CERTAIN]
[AND ][JUST ][THE ][THING]
[THAT ][WE ][HOPED ][FOR]
[WAS ][BUILDING ][UP]
[INTO ][SOMETHING ][MORE]
[OH ][I'VE ][BEEN]
[SEARCHING ][SEARCHING]
[TRYING ][TO ][FIND]
[THE ][WORDS ][TO ][SAY]
[OH ][I'VE ][BEEN]
[SEARCHING ][SEARCHING]
[TRYING ][TO ][GET ][BACK]
[TO ][THE ][LOVE ][WE]
[MADE ][YESTERDAY]
[~~~]
[REMEMBER ][HOW ][WE]
[STARTED ][ON]
[A ][SUMMER'S ][NIGHT]
[TOO ][YOUNG ][TO ][KNOW]
[ABOUT ][WHAT ][MIGHT]
[AND ][JUST ][AS ][WELL]
[AS ][WE ][MIGHT ][NOT]
[OF ][EVER ][STARTED ][ON]
[THIS ][COURSE ][AT ][ALL]
[REMEMBER ][HOW ][WE]
[STARTED ][ON ][A]
[SUMMER'S ][NIGHT]
[TOO ][YOUNG ][TO ][KNOW]
[ABOUT ][WHAT ][MIGHT]
[AND ][JUST ][AS ][WELL]
[AS ][WE ][MIGHT ][NOT]
[OF ][EVER ][STARTED ][ON]
[THIS ][COURSE ][AT ][ALL]
