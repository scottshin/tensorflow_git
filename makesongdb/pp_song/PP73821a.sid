[I HAVE ][SEEN]
[THE ][MORNING]
[BURNING ][GOLDEN]
[ON ][THE ][MOUNTAIN]
[IN ][THE ][SKIES]
[ACHING ][WITH ][THE ][FEELING]
[OF ][THE ][FREEDOM]
[OF ][AN ][EAGLE]
[WHEN ][SHE ][FLIES]
[TURNING ][ON ][THE ][WORLD]
[THE ][WAY ][SHE ][SMILED]
[UPON ][MY ][SOUL]
[AS ][I LAY ][DYING]
[HEALING ][AS ][THE ][COLORS]
[IN ][THE ][SUNSHINE]
[AND ][THE ][SHADOWS]
[OF ][HER ][EYES]
[WAKING ][IN ][THE ][MORNING]
[TO ][THE ][FEELING]
[OF ][HER ][FINGERS]
[ON ][MY ][SKIN]
[WIPING ][OUT ][THE ][TRACES]
[OF ][THE ][PEOPLE]
[AND ][THE ][PLACES]
[THAT ][I'VE ][BEEN]
[TEACHING ][ME]
[THAT ][YESTERDAY]
[WAS ][SOMETHING]
[THAT ][I NEVER]
[THOUGHT ][OF ][TRYING]
[TALKING ][OF ][TOMORROW]
[AND ][THE ][MONEY]
[LOVE ][AND ][TIME]
[WE ][HAD ][TO ][SPEND]
[LOVING ][HER ][WAS ][EASIER]
[THAN ][ANYTHING]
[I'LL ][EVER ][DO ][AGAIN]
[COMING ][CLOSE ][TOGETHER]
[WITH ][A FEELING ][THAT ][I'D]
[NEVER ][KNOWN ][BEFORE]
[IN ][MY ][TIME]
[SHE ][AIN'T ][ASHAMED]
[TO ][BE ][A WOMAN]
[OR ][AFRAID]
[TO ][BE ][A FRIEND]
[I DON'T ][KNOW]
[THE ][ANSWER]
[TO ][THE ][EASY ][WAY]
[SHE ][OPENED ][EV'RY ][DOOR]
[IN ][MY ][MIND]
[BUT ][DREAMING]
[WAS ][AS ][EASY]
[AS ][BELIEVING]
[IT ][WAS ][NEVER]
[GONNA ][END]
[AND ][LOVING ][HER]
[WAS ][EASIER]
[THAN ][ANYTHING]
[I'LL ][EVER ][DO ][AGAIN]
[AND ][LOVING ][HER]
[WAS ][EASIER]
[THAN ][ANYTHING]
[I'LL ][EVER ][DO ][AGAIN]
