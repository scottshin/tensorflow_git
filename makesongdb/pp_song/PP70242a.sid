Don't Look In My Eyes

[All ][the ][memories]
[are ][safely ][packed]
[And ][my ][dreams ][are ][needly]
[falling ][away]
[I've ][got ][nothin' ][to ][show]
[that ][I ][came ][very ][close]
[To ][a ][love ][that ][might]
[have ][worked ][out ][okey]
[All ][the ][tables]
[and ][chairs]
[They ][stand ][empty]
[and ][bare]
[And ][there ][isn't ][any ][sign]
[you ][are ][here]
[So ][just ][walk]
[through ][the ][door]
[But ][try ][not]
[to ][get ][too ][near]
[You ][might ][look]
[in ][my ][eyes]
[And ][see ][all ][the ][pain]
[The ][sadness]
[deep ][inside]
[Don't ][look ][in ][my ][eyes]
['coz ][that's]
[where ][I ][keep]
[Tears ][that]
[I ][can't ][hide]
[And ][if ][you ][just ][go]
[it'll ][be ][alright]
[I ][know ][I'll ][get]
[through ][the ][night]
[But ][I'll ][leave ][a ][smile]
['coz ][we ][say ][our]
[goodbyes]
[Just ][don't ][look]
[in ][my ][eyes]
[All ][our ][photographs]
[stollen ][away]
[And ][our ][letters ][have]
[been ][burned ][in ][the ][fire]
[There ][is ][nothing]
['round ][here]
[That ][will]
[make ][you ][believe]
[We ][have ][nights ][of]
[tender ][love ][and ][desire]
[If ][it ][seems]
[to ][be ][great]
[Well ][I ][like ][it]
[that ][way]
[There ][is ][nothin']
[to ][remind ][me ][of ][you]
[So ][just ][walk]
[through ][that ][door]
[But ][be ][sure]
[whatever ][you ][do]
[Don't ][look]
[in ][my ][eyes]
[And ][see ][all ][the ][pain]
[The ][sadness]
[deep ][inside]
[Don't ][look ][in ][my ][eyes]
['coz ][that's]
[where ][I ][keep]
[The ][tears ][that]
[I ][can't ][hide]
[And ][if ][you ][just ][go]
[it'll ][be ][alright]
[I ][know ][I'll ][get]
[through ][the ][night]
[And ][I'll ][leave ][a ][smile]
['coz ][we ][say ][our]
[goodbyes]
[Just ][don't ][look]
[in ][my ][eyes]
[Don't ][look ][in ][my ][eyes]
[And ][see ][all ][the ][pain]
[The ][sadness ][deep]
[inside]
[Don't ][look ][in ][my ][eyes]
['coz ][that's]
[where ][I ][keep]
[The ][tears ][that]
[I ][cans't ][hide]
[And ][if ][you ][just ][go]
[it'll ][be ][alright]
[I ][know ][I'll ][get]
[through ][the ][night]
[And ][I'll ][leave]
[a ][smile]
['coz ][we ][say ][our]
[goodbyes]
[Just ][don't ][look]
[in ][my ][eyes]
[Don't ][look ][in ][my ][eyes]
[Please ][don't ][look]
[in ][my ][eyes]
