[I ][dream ][of ][Jeanie ][with]
[the ][light ][brown ][hair]
[born ][like ][a ][vapor]
[on ][the ][summer ][air]
[I ][see ][her ][tripping]
[where ][the ][bright]
[streams ][play]
[Happy ][as ][the ][daisies]
[that ][dance ][on ][her ][way]
[Many ][were]
[the ][wild ][notes]
[her ][merry ][voice]
[would ][pour]
[Many ][were]
[the ][blithe ][birds]
[that ][warbled ][them ][o'er]
[Oh]
[I ][dream ][of ][Jeanie ][with]
[the ][light ][brown ][hair]
[floating ][like ][a ][vapor]
[on ][the ][soft ][summer ][air]
