FORTRESS AROUND YOUR HEART

Sting

[Under ][the ][ruins]
[of ][a ][walled ][city]
[crumbling ][towers ][in]
[beams ][of ][yellow ][light]
[No ][flags ][of ][truce,]
[no ][cries ][of ][pity;]
[the ][siege ][guns]
[had ][been ][pounding]
[through ][the ][night]
[It ][took ][a ][day]
[to ][build ][the ][city]
[We ][walked ][through]
[its ][streets ][in]
[the ][afternoon]
[As ][I ][returned ][across]
[the ][fields ][I'd ][known]
[I ][recognized ][the]
[walls ][that]
[I'd ][once ][made]
[Had ][to ][stop]
[in ][my ][tracks]
[for ][fear ][of ][walking]
[on ][the ][mines ][I'd ][laid]
[And ][if ][I've ][built]
[this ][fortress]
[around ][your ][heart]
[encircled ][you ][in]
[trenches ][and]
[barbed ][wire]
[then ][let ][me]
[build ][a ][bridge]
[for ][I ][cannot]
[fill ][the ][chasm]
[and ][let ][me ][set ][the]
[battlements ][on ][fire]
[~~~]
[Then ][I ][went ][off ][to]
[fight ][some ][battle]
[that ][I'd]
[invented]
[inside ][my ][head]
[Away ][so ][long ][for]
[years ][and ][years]
[you ][probably ][thought]
[or ][even ][wished]
[that ][I ][was ][dead]
[While ][the ][armies]
[are ][all ][sleeping]
[beneath ][the]
[tattered]
[flag ][we'd ][made]
[I ][had ][to ][stop]
[in ][my ][tracks]
[for ][fear ][of ][walking]
[on ][the ][mines ][I'd ][laid]
[And ][if ][I've ][built]
[this ][fortress]
[around ][your ][heart]
[encircled ][you ][in]
[trenches ][and]
[barbed ][wire]
[then ][let ][me]
[build ][a ][bridge]
[for ][I ][cannot]
[fill ][the ][chasm]
[and ][let ][me ][set ][the]
[battlements ][on ][fire]
[~~~]
[This ][prison ][has]
[now ][become ][your ][home]
[a ][sentence ][you]
[seem ][prepared ][to ][pay]
[It ][took ][a ][day]
[to ][build ][the ][city]
[We ][walked ][through]
[its ][streets ][in]
[the ][afternoon]
[As ][I ][returned ][across]
[the ][lands ][I'd ][known]
[I ][recognized ][the]
[fields ][where]
[I'd ][once ][played]
[Had ][to ][stop]
[in ][my ][tracks]
[for ][fear ][of ][walking]
[on ][the ][mines ][I'd ][laid]
[And ][if ][I've ][built]
[this ][fortress]
[around ][your ][heart]
[encircled ][you ][in]
[trenches ][and]
[barbed ][wire]
[then ][let ][me]
[build ][a ][bridge]
[for ][I ][cannot]
[fill ][the ][chasm]
[and ][let ][me ][set ][the]
[battlements ][on ][fire]
