I DREAMED A DREAM



FROM "LES MISERABLES"

[I DREAMED ][A DREAM]
[IN ][TIME ][GONE ][BY]
[WHEN ][HOPE ][WAS ][HIGH]
[AND ][LIFE ][WORTH]
[LIVING]
[I DREAMED ][THAT ][LOVE]
[WOULD ][NEVER ][DIE]
[I DREAMED ][THAT ][GOD]
[WOULD ][BE ][FORGIVING]
[THEN ][I WAS ][YOUNG]
[AND ][UNAFRAID]
[WHEN ][DREAMS ][WERE]
[MADE ][AND ][USED]
[AND ][WASTED]
[THERE ][WAS ][NO ][RANSOM]
[TO ][BE ][PAID]
[NO ][SONG ][UNSUNG]
[NO ][WINE ][UNTASTED]
[BUT ][THE ][TIGERS]
[COME ][AT ][NIGHT]
[WITH ][THEIR ][VOICES]
[SOFT ][AS ][THUNDER]
[AS ][THEY ][TEAR ][YOUR]
[HOPES ][APART]
[AS ][THEY ][TURN ][YOUR]
[DREAMS ][TO ][SHAME]
[HE ][SLEPT ][A SUMMER]
[BY ][MY ][SIDE]
[HE ][FILLED ][MY ][DAYS]
[WITH ][ENDLESS ][WONDER]
[HE ][TOOK ][MY ][CHILDHOOD]
[IN ][HIS ][STRIDE]
[BUT ][HE ][WAS ][GONE]
[WHEN ][AUTUMN ][CAME]
[AND ][STILL ][I DREAMED]
[HE'D ][COME ][TO ][ME]
[THAT ][WE ][WOULD ][LIVE]
[THE ][YEARS ][TOGETHER]
[BUT ][THERE ][ARE ][DREAMS]
[THAT ][CANNOT ][BE]
[AND ][THERE ][ARE ][STORMS]
[WE ][CANNOT ][WEATHER]
[I HAD ][A DREAM ][MY]
[LIFE ][WOULD ][BE]
[SO ][DIFFERENT ][FROM]
[THIS ][HELL ][I'M ][LIVING]
[SO ][DIFFERENT ][NOW]
[FROM ][WHAT ][IT ][SEEMED]
[NOW ][LIFE ][HAS ][KILLED]
[THE ][DREAM ][I DREAMED]
