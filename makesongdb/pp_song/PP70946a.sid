Four Strong Winds

[Think ][I'll ][go ][out]
[to ][Alberta]
[Weather's ][good]
[there ][in ][the ][fall]
[I ][got ][some ][friends]
[that ][I ][could ][go]
[to ][workin' ][for]
[Still ][I ][wish ][you'd]
[change ][your ][mind]
[If ][I ][asked ][you]
[one ][more ][time]
[But ][we've ][been]
[through ][this]
[a ][hundred ][times]
[before]
[Four ][strong ][winds]
[that ][blow ][lonely]
[Seven ][seas ][that]
[run ][high]
[All ][those ][things]
[that ][don't ][change]
[Come ][what ][may]
[If ][the ][good ][times]
[are ][all ][gone]
[Then ][I'm ][bound]
[for ][movin' ][on]
[I'll ][look ][for ][you]
[if ][I'm ][ever ][back]
[this ][way]
[If ][I ][get ][there]
[before ][the ][snow ][flies]
[And ][if ][things ][are]
[lookin' ][good]
[You ][could ][meet ][me]
[if ][I ][sent ][you]
[Down ][the ][fare]
[But ][by ][then ][it]
[would ][be ][winter]
[Not ][too ][much ][for]
[you ][to ][do]
[And ][those ][winds]
[sure ][can ][blow]
[cold ][way ][out ][there]
[Four ][strong ][winds]
[that ][blow ][lonely]
[Seven ][seas ][that]
[run ][high]
[All ][those ][things]
[that ][don't ][change]
[Come ][what ][may]
[If ][the ][good ][times]
[are ][all ][gone]
[So ][I'm ][bound]
[for ][movin' ][on]
[I'll ][look ][for ][you]
[if ][I'm ][ever ][pass]
[this ][way]
[I'll ][look ][for ][you]
[if ][I'm ][ever ][pass]
[this ][way]
[I'll ][look ][for ][you]
[if ][I'm ][ever ][pass]
[this ][way]
