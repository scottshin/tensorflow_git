SOUND OF SILENCE



SIMON AND GARFUNKELL

[Hello ][darkness]
[my ][old ][friend]
[I've ][come ][to ][talk]
[to ][you ][again]
[Because ][the ][vision]
[slowly ][creepin']
[Left ][is ][seen ][while]
[I ][was ][sleeping]
[and ][the ][vision]
[that ][was ][planted]
[in ][my ][brain]
[still ][remain]
[and ][touch ][the ][sound]
[of ][silence]
[In ][restless ][dreams]
[I ][walked ][alone]
[Narrow ][streets ][of]
[coble ][stone]
[Neath ][the ][allow]
[of ][a ][street ][lamp]
[I ][turn ][my ][collar]
[to ][the]
[cold ][and ][damb]
[When ][my ][eyes ][were]
[stabbed]
[by ][the ][flash ][of ][a]
[neon ][light]
[split ][the]
[night]
[touch ][the ][sound]
[of ][silence]
[In ][the ][naked]
[light ][I ][saw]
[Ten ][thousand]
[people ][maybe ][more]
[People ][talking]
[without ][speaking,]
[People ][hearing]
[without ][listening,]
[People ][writing]
[songs]
[that ][voices ][never]
[share]
[no ][one ][dare]
[disturb ][the ][sound]
[of ][silence]
[Fools ][said ][I ][you]
[do ][not ][know]
[Silence ][like ][a]
[cancer ][grow]
[Take ][my ][hands ][that]
[I ][might ][reach ][you]
[Hear ][my ][words ][that]
[I ][might ][teach ][you]
[But ][the ][word]
[like ][silence]
[raindrops ][fell]
[And ][touch ][the]
[sound ][of ][silence]
[And ][the ][people]
[bowed ][and ][pray]
[to ][the ][neon ][god]
[they ][made]
[and ][the ][Son ][flash]
[out ][in ][it's ][warning]
[to ][the ][word ][that]
[it ][was ][forming]
[and ][the ][sign ][said]
[the ][words ][of ][the]
[prophets ][are]
[written ][on ][a]
[subway ][walls]
[tenement ][halls]
[and ][touch ][the]
[sound ][of ][silence]
[~~~]
