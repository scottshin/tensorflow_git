HELEN REDDY

[You ][say ][it ][would]
[be ][better]
[If ][we ][stop ][seeing]
[each ][other]
[If ][you ][had ][only]
[met ][me ][first]
[When ][you ][were ][free]
[coz ][now ][you've]
[got ][commitments]
[I should ][not]
[expect ][things ][from ][you]
[That ][you ][can ][give ][to ][me]
[Oh ][but ][baby]
[can't ][you ][see]
[I can't ][say]
[goodbye ][to ][you]
[No ][matter ][how ][I try]
[You're ][such ][a]
[part ][of ][me]
[Without ][you ][I would ][die]
[Deep ][in ][the ][heart ][of ][me]
[I know ][that ][you]
[and ][I were ][meant]
[to ][be ][forever]
[I can't ][tell]
[you ][goodbye]
[Neither ][of]
[us ][planned ][that]
[we ][would ][fall]
[in ][love ][this ][way]
[And ][since ][we ][did]
[Why ][should ][we ][apart]
[Sometimes]
[some ][things ][happen]
[That ][can ][never]
[be ][explained]
[Now ][it's ][too ][late ][for ][me]
[I've ][already]
[given ][you ][my ][heart]
[I can't ][say]
[goodbye ][to ][you]
[No ][matter ][how ][I try]
[You're ][such ][a]
[part ][of ][me]
[Without ][you ][I would ][die]
[Deep ][in ][the ][heart ][of ][me]
[I know ][that ][you]
[and ][I were ][meant]
[to ][be ][forever]
[I can't ][tell]
[you ][goodbye]
[Who ][knows ][why ][we ][choose]
[When ][we ][choose]
[the ][one's ][we ][love]
[Who ][knows ][why]
[we ][do ][the ][things]
[we ][do ][when]
[we're ][in ][love]
[I know ][that ][you're]
[a decent ][man]
[And ][you ][try ][to]
[do ][what's ][fair]
[But ][how ][can ][I forget]
[All ][the ][feelings]
[we ][have ][shared]
[I can't ][say]
[goodbye ][to ][you]
[No ][matter ][how ][I try]
[You're ][such ][a part ][of ][me]
[Without ][you ][I would ][die]
[Deep ][in ][the ][heart ][of ][me]
[I know ][that ][you]
[and ][I were ][meant]
[to ][be ][forever]
[I can't ][tell]
[you ][goodbye]
