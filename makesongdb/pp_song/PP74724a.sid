[When ][I ][wake ][up]
[each ][morning]
[Trying ][to ][find ][myself]
[And ][if ][I'm ][ever ][the]
[least ][unsure]
[I ][always ][reminds]
[myself]
[Though ][you're ][someone]
[in ][this ][world]
[That ][I'll ][always]
[choose ][to ][love]
[From ][now ][on ][you're]
[only ][someone ][that]
[I ][used ][to ][love]
[As ][for ][me]
[it's ][getting ][down]
[To ][the ][last ][unspoken]
[part]
[When ][you ][must ][begin]
[to ][ease]
[The ][pain ][of ][a ][broken]
[heart]
[Tell ][me ][why ][should]
[I ][even ][care]
[If ][I ][have ][to ][lose]
[your ][love]
[From ][now ][on ][you're]
[only ][someone ][that]
[I ][used ][to ][love]
[I ][wish ][it ][was ][enough]
[for ][you]
[All ][the ][love]
[I ][had ][to ][give]
[And ][I ][did ][my ][best ][to]
[keep ][you ][satisfied]
[I ][guess ][you'll]
[never ][know]
[how ][much ][I ][tried]
[I ][really ][tried]
[And ][if ][ever ][our ][paths]
[should ][cross ][again]
[Well ][you ][won't ][find ][me]
[Being ][the ][one ][to ][get]
[lost ][again]
[Once ][I ][had ][so ][much]
[to ][give]
[But ][you ][just ][refused]
[my ][love]
[From ][now ][on ][you're]
[only ][someone ][that]
[I ][used ][to ][love]
