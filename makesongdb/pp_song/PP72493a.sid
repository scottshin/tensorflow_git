[She ][looks ][in ][the]
[mirror ][and ][stares ][at]
[the ][wrinkles ][that]
[wern't ][there]
[yesterday ][and ][thinks]
[of ][the ][young ][man ][she]
[almost ][married]
[What ][would ][he ][think]
[if ][he ][saw ][her ][this]

[She ][picks ][up ][her]
[apron ][in ][little ][girl]
[fashion ][as ][something]
[comes ][into ][her ][mind]
[Slowly ][starts ][dancing]
[remembering ][her]
[girlhood ][and ][all ][of]
[the ][boys ][she ][had]
[waiting ][in ][line]
[Ah ][such ][are ][the]
[dreams ][of ][the]

[You ][see ][everywhere]
[anytime ][of ][the ][day]
[An ][everyday ][housewife]
[who ][gave ][up ][the ][good]

[The ][photograph ][album]
[she ][takes ][from ][the]
[closet ][and ][slowly]
[turns ][the ][page ][and]
[carefully ][picks ][up]
[the ][crumbling ][flower]
[the ][first ][one ][he ][gave]
[her ][now ][withered ][with]
[age]
[She ][closes ][her ][eyes]
[and ][touches ][the ][house]
[dress ][that ][suddenly]
[disappears ][and ][just]
[for ][the ][moment ][she's]
[wearing ][the ][gown]
[that ][broke ][all ][their]
[minds ][back ][so ][many]
[years]
[Ah ][such ][are ][the]
[dreams ][of ][the]
[everyday ][housewife]
[You ][see ][everywhere]
[anytime ][of ][the ][day]

[who ][gave ][up ][the ][good]
[life ][for ][me]
[Ah ][such ][are ][the]
