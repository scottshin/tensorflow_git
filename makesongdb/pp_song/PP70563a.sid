[WHEN ][I CALL]
[YOU ][UP]
[YOUR ][LINE'S ][ENGAGED]
[I HAVE ][HAD ][ENOUGH]
[SO ][ACT ][YOUR ][AGE]
[WE ][HAVE ][LOST]
[THE ][TIME]
[THAT ][WAS ][SO]
[HARD ][TO ][FIND]
[AND ][I WILL ][LOSE]
[MY ][MIND]
[IF ][YOU ][WON'T ][SEE ][ME]
[YOU ][WON'T ][SEE ][ME]
[I DON'T ][KNOW]
[WHY ][YOU]
[SHOULD ][WANT ][TO ][HIDE]
[BUT ][I CAN'T]
[GET ][THROUGH]
[MY ][HANDS ][ARE ][TIED]
[I WON'T ][WANT]
[TO ][STAY]
[I DON'T ][HAVE]
[MUCH ][TO ][SAY]
[BUT ][I CAN ][TURN ][AWAY]
[AND ][YOU ][WON'T ][SEE ][ME]
[YOU ][WON'T ][SEE ][ME]
[TIME ][AFTER ][TIME]
[YOU ][REFUSE]
[TO ][EVEN ][LISTEN]
[I WOULDN'T ][MIND]
[IF ][I KNEW]
[WHAT ][I WAS ][MISSING]
[THOUGH ][THE ][DAYS]
[ARE ][FEW]
[THEY'RE ][FILLED]
[WITH ][TEARS]
[AND ][SINCE ][I LOST ][YOU]
[IT ][FEELS ][LIKE ][YEARS]
[YES ][IT ][SEEMS]
[SO ][LONG]
[GIRL ][SINCE]
[YOU'VE ][BEEN ][GONE]
[AND ][I JUST ][CAN'T]
[GO ][ON]
[IF ][YOU ][WON'T ][SEE ][ME]
[YOU ][WON'T ][SEE ][ME]
[TIME ][AFTER ][TIME]
[YOU ][REFUSE]
[TO ][EVEN ][LISTEN]
[I WOULDN'T ][MIND]
[IF ][I KNEW]
[WHAT ][I WAS ][MISSING]
[THOUGH ][THE ][DAYS]
[ARE ][FEW]
[THEY'RE ][FILLED]
[WITH ][TEARS]
[AND ][SINCE ][I LOST ][YOU]
[IT ][FEELS ][LIKE ][YEARS]
