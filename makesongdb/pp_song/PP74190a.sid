[The ][days]
[of ][wine ][and ][roses]
[Laugh ][and ][run ][away]
[Like ][a child ][at ][play]
[Through ][the ][meadow]
[land ][towards]
[a closing ][door]
[A door ][marked]
[never ][more ][that]
[wasn't ][there ][before]
[The ][lonely ][night]
[discloses ][just]
[a passing ][breeze]
[Filled ][with]
[memories ][of ][the]
[golden ][smile]
[That ][introduced ][me ][to]
[The ][days ][of ][wine]
[and ][roses ][and ][you]
