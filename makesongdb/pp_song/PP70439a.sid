Make Believe

[When ][I'm ][all ][alone]
[Pretending ][love]
[would ][come ][along]
[And ][even ][when]
[you're ][gone]
[Still ][that ][love]
[lingers ][on]
[Then ][suddenly ][I ][face]
[such ][emptiness]
[An ][evening ][just ][like]
[this ][brings ][loneliness]
[When ][I ][think ][of ][you]
[Those ][words ][were ][said]
[as ][if ][they're ][true]
[We ][knew ][our]
[love ][was ][strong]
[Even ][though]
[it ][was ][wrong]
[So ][I'll ][just ][put ][all]
[the ][stars ][in ][a ][song]
[It's ][just ][a ][make ][believe]
[But ][I ][just ][can't ][go ][on]
[Without ][your ][smile]
[without ][your ][touch]
[without ][your ][love]
[It's ][just ][a ][make]
[believe]
[But ][I ][just ][can't ][go ][on]
[I ][need ][your ][smile]
[I ][need ][your ][touch]
[I ][need ][your ][love]
[~~~]
[Now ][the ][night ][is ][through]
[It's ][time ][for ][me]
[to ][say ][adieu]
[I'm ][longing ][for]
[the ][past]
[But ][it ][just]
[couldn't ][last]
[So ][I'll ][just ][put ][all]
[the ][stars ][in ][a ][song]
[It's ][just ][a ][make ][believe]
[But ][I ][just ][can't ][go ][on]
[Without ][your ][smile]
[without ][your ][touch]
[without ][your ][love]
[It's ][just ][a ][make]
[believe]
[But ][I ][just ][can't ][go ][on]
[I ][need ][your ][smile]
[I ][need ][your ][touch]
[I ][need ][your ][love]
