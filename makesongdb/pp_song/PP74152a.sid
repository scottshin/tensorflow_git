PICTURE OF ME
(WITHOUT YOU)


GEORGE JONES

[IMAGINE ][A WORLD]
[WHERE ][NO ][MUSIC]
[WAS ][PLAYING]
[THEN ][THINK ][OF ][A CHURCH]
[WITH ][NOBODY ][PRAYING]
[IF ][YOU'VE ][EVER ][LOOKED ][UP]
[AT ][A SKY ][WITH ][NO ][BLUE]
[THEN ][YOU'VE ][SEEN]
[A PICTURE ][OF ][ME]
[WITHOUT ][YOU]
[HAVE ][YOU ][WALKED]
[IN ][A GARDEN]
[WHERE ][NOTHING]
[WAS ][GROWING]
[OR ][STOOD ][BY ][A RIVER]
[WHEN ][NOTHING ][WAS ][FLOWING]
[IF ][YOU'VE ][SEEN]
[A RED ][ROSE]
[UNKISSED ][BY ][THE ][DEW]
[THEN ][YOU'VE ][SEEN]
[A PICTURE ][OF ][ME]
[WITHOUT ][YOU]
[CAN ][YOU ][PICTURE ][HEAVEN]
[WITH ][NO ][ANGELS ][SINGING]
[OR ][A QUIET]
[SUNDAY ][MORNING]
[WITH ][NO ][CHURCH ][BELLS]
[RINGING]
[IF ][YOU'VE ][WATCHED]
[AS ][THE ][HEART ][OF]
[A CHILD]
[BREAKS ][IN ][TWO]
[THEN ][YOU'VE ][SEEN]
[A PICTURE ][OF ][ME]
[WITHOUT ][YOU]
