[FOUR ][MEN]
[IN ][A BIG ][TRUCK]
[CAME ][TODAY]
[THEY ][WALKED ][RIGHT ][IN]
[AND ][TOOK ][YOUR]
[THINGS ][AWAY]
[AND ][STANDING ][AT]
[THE ][DOOR]
[I WATCHED ][THEM]
[DRIVE ][AWAY]
[NOW ][IT]
[ALL ][COMES ][BACK]
[LIKE ][IT ][WAS ][YESTERDAY]
[I HAD ][STOPPED ][OFF]
[FOR ][A DRINK]
[ON ][MY ][WAY ][HOME]
[SAW ][AN ][OLD ][GIRL ][FRIEND]
[IN ][A CORNER]
[ALL ][ALONE]
[SHE ][SAID]
["LET'S ][HAVE ][A DRINK]
[JUST ][FOR]
[OLD ][TIMES ][SAKE"]
[I SAT ][DOWN ][WITH ][HER]
[AND ][THAT ][WAS]
[MY ][MISTAKE]
[NOW ][WHERE ][LOVE]
[USED ][TO ][LIVE]
[THERE'S ][JUST]
[AN ][EMPTY ][HOME]
[FOR ][WHEN ][JEALOUSY]
[MOVED ][IN]
[EV'RYTHING ][WENT ][WRONG]
[IF ][YOU'D ][ONLY]
[TRUSTED ][ME]
[AND ][HAD ][THE ][HEART]
[TO ][FORGIVE]
[THERE'D ][BE ][LOVE ][AGAIN]
[WHERE ][LOVE]
[USED ][TO ][LIVE]
[BUT ][SOMEDAY]
[I'LL ][BE ][LOOKIN' ][OUT]
[THE ][DOOR]
[AND ][THAT]
[SAME ][BIG ][TRUCK]
[WILL ][PULL ][UP ][HERE]
[ONCE ][MORE]
[I'LL ][WATCH]
[THE ][SAME ][FOUR ][MEN]
[AS ][THEY ][UNLOAD]
[LOVE ][AGAIN]
[AND ][PUT ][IT ][BACK]
[THE ][WAY]
[IT ][WAS ][BEFORE]
[AND ][WHERE ][LOVE]
[USED ][TO ][LIVE]
[THERE'LL ][BE]
[A HAPPY ][HOME]
[WITH ][FAITH]
[AND ][UNDERSTANDING]
[NOTHING ][CAN ][GO ][WRONG]
[WHEN ][YOU]
[FIN'LLY ][REALIZE]
[THERE'S ][NOTHING]
[TO ][FORGIVE]
[THERE'LL ][BE ][LOVE ][AGAIN]
[WHERE ][LOVE]
[USED ][TO ][LIVE]
[THERE'LL ][BE ][LOVE ][AGAIN]
[WHERE ][LOVE]
[USED ][TO ][LIVE]
