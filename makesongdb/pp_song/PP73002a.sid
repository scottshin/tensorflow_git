THE MAN WITH CHILD
IN HIS EYES


Kate Bush

[I ][HEAR ][HIM ][BEFORE]
[I ][GO ][TO ][SLEEP]
[AND ][FOCUS ][ON ][THE ][DAY]
[THAT'S ][BEEN ][I ][REALIZE]
[HE'S ][THERE ][WHEN]
[I ][TURN ][THE ][LIGHT ][OFF]
[AND ][TURN ][OVER]
[NOBODY ][KNOWS]
[ABOUT ][MY ][MAN]
[THEY ][THINK ][HE'S ][LOST]
[ON ][SOME ][HORIZON]
[AND ][SUDDENLY]
[I ][FIND ][MYSELF]
[LISTEN' ][TO ][A ][MAN]
[I'VE ][NEVER ][KNOWN ][BEFORE]
[TELLING ][ME]
['BOUT ][THE ][SEA]
[ALL ][HIS ][LOVE]
['TILL ][ETERNITY]
[OOH ][HE'S ][HERE ][AGAIN]
[THE ][MAN ][WITH ][THE ][CHILD]
[IN ][HIS ][EYES]
[OOH ][HE'S ][HERE ][AGAIN]
[THE ][MAN ][WITH ][THE ][CHILD]
[IN ][HIS ][EYES]
[HE'S ][VERY ][UNDERSTANDING]
[AND ][HE'S ][SO ][AWARE ][OF]
[ALL ][MY ][SITUATIONS]
[AND ][WHEN ][I ][STAY]
[UP ][LATE]
[HE'S ][ALWAYS ][WAITING]
[BUT ][I ][FEEL]
[HIM ][HESITATE]
[OH ][I'M ][SO ][WORRIED]
[ABOUT ][MY ][LOVE]
[THEY ][SAY]
["NO ][NO]
[IT ][WON'T ][LAST ][FOREVER"]
[AND ][HERE ][I ][AM ][AGAIN]
[MY ][GIRL]
[WONDERING ][WHAT]
[ON ][EARTH]
[I'M ][DOING ][HERE]
[MAYBE ][HE ][DOESN'T]
[LOVE ][ME]
[I ][JUST ][TOOK ][A ][TRIP]
[ON ][MY ][LOVE ][FOR ][HIM]
[OOH ][HE'S ][HERE ][AGAIN]
[THE ][MAN ][WITH ][THE ][CHILD]
[IN ][HIS ][EYES]
[OOH ][HE'S ][HERE ][AGAIN]
[THE ][MAN ][WITH ][THE ][CHILD]
[IN ][HIS ][EYES]
