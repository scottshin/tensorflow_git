[Life ][is ][full]
[of ][lots ][of ][ups]
[and ][downs]
[but ][the ][distance]
[feels ][further]
[when ][it's ][headed]
[for ][the ][ground]
[And ][there's ][nothing]
[more ][painful]
[then ][to ][let]
[your ][feelings ][take]
[you ][down]
[It's ][so ][hard ][to ][know]
[the ][way ][you]
[feel ][inside]
[when ][there's ][many]
[thoughts ][and ][feelings]
[that ][you ][hide]
[But ][you ][might]
[feel ][better]
[if ][you ][let ][me]
[walk ][with ][you]
[by ][your ][side]
[And ][when ][you ][need]
[a ][shoulder ][to ][cry ][on]
[when ][you ][need]
[a ][friend ][to ][rely ][on]
[and ][the ][whole ][is ][gone]
[and ][you're ][left ][alone]
[I'll ][be ][there]
[I'll ][be ][your]
[shoulder ][to ][cry ][on]
[I'll ][be ][there]
[I'll ][be ][your]
[friend ][to ][rely ][on]
[When ][the ][whole]
[world's ][gone]
[you ][won't ][be ][alone]
['cause ][I'll ][be ][there]
[All ][of ][the ][times]
[when ][ev'rythings]
[is ][wrong ][and ][you're]
[feeling ][like]
[there's ][no ][use]
[going ][on]
[You ][can't ][give ][it ][up]
[I'll ][help ][you ][work]
[it ][out ][and ][carry ][on]
[Side ][by ][side]
[with ][you ][till ][the ][end]
[I'll ][always ][be]
[the ][one ][to ][firmly]
[hold ][your ][hand]
[No ][matter ][what ][is ][said]
[or ][done ][our ][love ][will]
[always ][continue ][on]
[Ev'ryone ][needs]
[a ][shoulder ][to ][cry ][on]
[ev'ryone ][needs]
[a ][friend ][to ][rely ][on]
[When ][the ][whole]
[world ][is ][gone]
[you ][won't ][be ][alone]
['cause ][I'll ][be ][there]
[I'll ][be ][your]
[shoulder ][to ][cry ][on]
[I'll ][be ][there]
[I'll ][be ][your]
[friend ][to ][rely ][on]
[When ][the ][whole]
[world ][is ][gone]
[you ][won't ][be ][alone]
['cause ][I'll ][be ][there]
[You'll ][have ][my]
[shoulder ][to ][cry ][on]
[I'll ][be ][there]
[I'll ][be ][the]
[one ][to ][rely ][on]
[When ][the ][whole]
[world ][is ][gone]
[you ][won't ][be ][alone]
['cause ][I'll ][be ][there]
[And ][when ][the ][whole]
[world's ][gone]
[you'll ][always ][have ][my]
