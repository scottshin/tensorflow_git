[There ][she ][goes]
[There ][she ][goes ][again]
[Racing ][through]
[my ][brain]
[And ][I ][just]
[can't ][contain]
[This ][feeling]
[that ][remains]
[There ][she ][blows]
[There ][she ][blows ][again]
[Pulsing ][through]
[my ][vein]
[And ][I ][just ][can't]
[contain]
[This ][feeling ][that]
[remains]
[There ][she ][goes]
[There ][she ][goes ][again]
[Racing ][through]
[my ][brain]
[And ][I ][just ][can't]
[contain]
[This ][feeling ][that]
[remains]
[There ][she ][goes]
[There ][she ][goes ][again]
[She ][calls ][my ][name]
[She ][pulls ][my ][train]
[No ][one ][else ][could]
[heal ][my ][pain]
[And ][I ][just ][can't]
[contain]
[This ][feeling ][that]
[remains]
[There ][she ][goes]
[There ][she ][goes ][again]
[Chasing ][down ][my ][lane]
[And ][I ][just ][can't]
[contain]
[This ][feeling ][that]
[remains]
[There ][she ][goes]
[There ][she ][goes]
[There ][she ][goes]
