[Thinkin' ][of ][the]
[faces ][I've ][seen]

[young ][and ][green;]
[I ][was]
[fallin' ][back ][then]
[But ][now ][I'm ][workin']
[on ][building ][a ][fire]
[and ][flirtin']
[with ][that ][old ][desire]
[and ][fallin' ][again]
[into ][the ][wind]
[I ][fall ][in ][love ][again]

[Well, ][you ][think ][that]
