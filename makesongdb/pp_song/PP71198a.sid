[I ][feel ][such ][sorrow ][I]
[feel ][such ][shame]
[I ][know ][I ][won't ][arrive]
[on ][time]
[Before ][whatever ][out]
[there ][is ][gone]
[What ][can ][I ][do ][that ][day]
[is ][done]
[It's ][just ][a ][promise]
[that ][I ][made]
[I ][said ][I'd ][walk ][in ][her]
[parade]
[Hot ][scalding ][tears ][I]
[thought ][would ][flow]
[still ][in ][my ][heart]
[they'll ][never ][show]
[That ][day ][is ][done ][that]
[day ][is ][done]
[You ][know ][where]
[I've ][gone]
[I ][won't ][be ][coming]
[back ][that ][day ][is ][done]
[Well ][I ][recall ][the ][time]
[and ][place ][when ][they]
[announced ][her ][precious]
[face]
[I ][thought ][at ][once ][my]
[heart ][would ][burst]
[Still ][everytime]
[is ][like ][the ][first]
[There ][was ][applause]
[when ][she ][stepped ][up]
[I ][wish ][that ][I ][could]
[interupt]
[I ][made ][no ][sigh ][I ][made]
[no ][sound]
[I ][know ][I ][must ][stay]
[underground]
[That ][day ][is ][done ][that]
[day ][is ][done]
[You ][know ][where]
[I've ][gone]
[I ][won't ][be ][coming]
[back ][that ][day ][is ][done]
[That's ][why ][she ][walks]
[or ][so ][they ][say]
[She ][always ][knew ][just]
[what ][I ][needed]
[Now ][if ][she ][would ][just]
[look ][my ][way ][one ][time]
[before ][they ][proceed]
[She ][sprinkles ][flowers]
[in ][the ][dirt]
[That's ][when ][a ][thrill]
[becomes ][a ][hurt]
[I ][know ][I'll ][never]
[see ][her ][face ][she]
[walks ][away ][from ][my]
[resting ][place]
[That ][day ][is ][done ][that]
[day ][is ][done]
[You ][know ][where]
[I've ][gone]
[I ][won't ][be ][coming]
[back ][that ][day ][is ][done]
[Well ][you ][know ][where]
[I've ][gone]
[I ][won't ][be ][coming ][back]
[that ][day ][is ][done]
