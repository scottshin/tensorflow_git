[Woh ][oh ][yeah]
[Mm ][doo ][doo ][ooh ][ah]
[These ][are ][the]
[days ][of ][the ][open ][hand]
[they ][will]
[not ][be ][the ][last]
[Look ][around ][now]
[these ][are ][the ][days]
[of ][the ][beggars]
[and ][the ][choosers]
[This ][is ][the ][year]
[of ][the ][hungry ][man]
[whose ][place]
[is ][in ][the ][past]
[hand ][in ][hand]
[with ][ignorance]
[and]
[legitimate ][excuses]
[The ][rich ][declare]
[themselves ][poor]
[and ][most ][of]
[us ][are ][not ][sure]
[if ][we ][have ][too ][much]
[but ][we'll]
[take ][our ][chances]
['cause ][God]
[stopped ][keeping ][score]
[I ][guess]
[somewhere]
[along ][the ][way]
[He ][must ][have ][let ][us]
[all ][out ][to ][playay;]
[turned ][His ][back ][and]
[all ][God's ][children]
[crept ][out]
[the ][back ][door]
[And ][it's ][hard ][to ][love]
[there's ][so]
[much ][to ][hate]
[hanging ][on ][to ][hope]
[when ][there ][is ][no]
[hope ][to ][speak ][of]
[And ][the]
[wounded ][skies ][above]
[say ][it's ][much]
[much ][too ][late;]
[well ][maybe ][we]
[should ][all ][be]
[praying ][for ][time]
[Doo ][doo ][ooh ][ah]
[Mm ][woh ][woh ][yeah]
[~~~]
[These ][are ][the ][days]
[of ][the ][empty ][hand]
[Oh ][you ][hold ][on]
[to ][what ][you ][can]
[and ][charity ][is]
[a ][coat ][you]
[wear ][twice ][a ][year]
[This ][is ][the ][year]
[of ][the ][guilty ][man]
[Your]
[television]
[takes ][a ][stand]
[and ][you ][find]
[that ][what ][was ][over]
[there ][is ][over ][here]
[So ][you ][scream]
[from ][behind ][your ][door]
[say ][what's ][mine ][is]
[mine ][and ][not ][yours]
[I ][may ][have ][too ][much]
[but ][I'll]
[take ][my ][chances]
['cause ][God]
[stopped ][keeping ][score]
[And ][you ][cling ][to ][the]
[things ][they ][sold ][you]
[Did ][you ][cover ][your]
[eyes ][when]
[they ][told ][you]
[that ][He]
[can't ][come ][back]
['cause ][He ][has ][no]
[children ][to]
[come ][back ][for?]
[It's ][hard ][to ][love]
[there's ][so]
[much ][to ][hate]
[hanging ][on ][to ][hope]
[when ][there ][is ][no]
[hope ][to ][speak ][of]
[And ][the]
[wounded ][skies ][above]
[say ][it's]
[much ][too ][late]
[so ][maybe ][we]
[should ][all ][be]
[praying ][for ][time]
[Doo ][doo ][doo]
[Woh ][oh ][yeah]
[~~~]
