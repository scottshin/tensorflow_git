[We ][didn't ][know]
[that ][times ][were ][lean]
[Around ][our ][house]
[the ][grass ][was ][green]
[It ][didn't ][seem]
[like ][things]
[were ][all ][that ][bad]
[I ][bet ][we ][walked]
[a ][thousand ][miles]
[chopping ][cotton]
[and ][pushing ][plows]
[and ][learning ][how]
[to ][give ][it ][all ][we ][had]
[As ][life ][went ][on]
[and ][years ][went ][by]
[we ][saw ][the ][light]
[in ][Daddy's ][eyes]
[and ][felt ][the ][love]
[in ][Mama's ][hands]
[They ][kept ][us ][warm]
[and ][kept ][us ][fed]
[and ][taught ][us ][how]
[to ][look ][ahead]
[Now ][looking ][back]
[I ][understand]
[We ][were ][walking]
[in ][high ][cotton]
[Old ][times ][there]
[are ][not ][forgotten]
[Those ][fertile]
[fields ][are]
[never ][far ][away]
[We ][were ][walking]
[in ][high ][cotton]
[Old ][times ][there]
[are ][not ][forgotten]
[Leaving ][home ][was]
[the ][hardest ][thing]
[we ][ever ][faced]
[~~~]
[When ][Sunday ][mornings]
[rolled ][around]
[we ][dressed ][up]
[in ][handmedowns]
[just ][in]
[time ][to ][gather]
[with ][the ][Church]
[Sometimes ][I ][think]
[how ][long ][it's ][been]
[and ][how ][it]
[impressed ][me ][then;]
[it ][was ][the ][only ][day]
[my ][daddy]
[wouldn't ][work]
[We ][were ][walking]
[in ][high ][cotton]
[Old ][times ][there]
[are ][not ][forgotten]
[Those ][fertile]
[fields ][are]
[never ][far ][away]
[We ][were ][walking]
[in ][high ][cotton]
[Old ][times ][there]
[are ][not ][forgotten]
[Leaving ][home ][was]
