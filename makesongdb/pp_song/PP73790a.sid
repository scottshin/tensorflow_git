[I TOLD ][HER]
[TO ][LEAVE ][ME ][ALONE]
[THAT'S ][WHAT ][SHE'S ][DONE]
[JUST ][WHAT ][SHE'S ][DONE]
[AND ][A HOUSE]
[BUILT ][FOR ][TWO]
[AIN'T ][A HOME]
[WHEN ][IT'S ][LIVED ][IN]
[BY ][ONE]
[ONE ][LONELY ][ONE]
[AND ][I CAN ][NO ][LONGER]
[HEAR ][FOOTSTEPS]
[FROM ][RIGHT ][DOWN]
[THE ][HALL]
[HERE ][COME]
[THE ][TEARDROPS]
[BITTER ][THEY ][ARE]
[HARDER ][THEY ][FALL]
[SHE ][CAUGHT ][ME ][LYIN']
[THEN ][SHE ][CAUGHT ][A TRAIN]
[THEN ][I CAUGHT ][A FEVER]
[WALKIN' ][HOME]
[IN ][THE ][RAIN]
[BUT ][IT'S ][OVER]
[AND ][UNDONE]
[SHE'S ][LEFT ][ME]
[ONCE ][AND ][FOR ][ALL]
[HERE ][COME]
[THE ][TEARDROPS]
[BITTER ][THEY ][ARE]
[HARDER ][THEY ][FALL]
[HERE ][COME]
[THE ][TEARDROPS]
[BITTER ][THEY ][ARE]
[HARDER ][THEY ][FALL]
