THE BEATLES

[Wednesday ][morning]
[At ][five ][o'clock]
[as ][the ][day ][begins]
[Silently ][closing]
[her ][bedroom ][door]
[Leaving ][the ][note]
[that ][she ][hoped]
[would ][say ][more]
[She ][goes ][downstairs ][to]
[The ][kitchen ][clutching]
[her ][handkerchief]
[Quietly ][turning]
[the ][backdoor ][key]
[Stepping ][outside]
[she ][is ][free]
[We ][gave ][her ][most ][of]
[our ][lives]
[Sacrified ][most ][of]
[our ][lives]
[We ][gave ][her ][everything]
[money ][could ][buy]
[Leaving ][home ][after]
[Living ][alone ][for]
[so ][many ][years]
[Father ][snores]
[as ][his ][wife]
[Gets ][into]
[her ][dressing ][gown]
[Picks ][up ][the ][letter]
[that's ][lying ][there]
[Standing ][alone ][at]
[the ][top ][of ][the ][stairs]
[She ][breaks ][down]
[and ][cries ][to]
[her ][husband]
[Daddy ][our ][baby's ][gone]
[Why ][would ][she ][treat]
[us ][so ][thoughtlessly]
[How ][could]
[she ][do ][this ][to ][me]
[We ][never ][thought]
[of ][ourselves]
[Never ][a ][thought]
[for ][ourselves]
[We ][struggled ][hard]
[all ][our ][lives]
[to ][get ][by]
[Bye ][bye]
[Friday ][morning]
[At ][nine ][o'clock]
[she ][is ][far ][away]
[Waiting ][to ][keep]
[the ][appointment]
[she ][made]
[Meeting ][a ][man]
[from ][the ][motor ][trade]
[What ][did ][we ][do]
[that ][was ][wrong]
[We ][didn't ][know]

[Fun ][is ][the ][one ][thing]
[that ][money ][can't ][buy]
