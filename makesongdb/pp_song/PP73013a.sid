[Spring ][was ][never]
[waiting ][for ][us, ][girl]
[It ][ran ][one ][step ][ahead]
[As ][we ][followed]
[in ][the ][dance]
[Between ][the]
[parted ][pages]
[that ][were ][pressed]
[In ][love's ][hot]
[fevered ][iron]
[Like ][a ][striped ][pair]
[of ][pants]
[MacArthur]
[Park ][is ][melting]
[in ][the ][dark]
[All ][the ][sweet,]
[green ][icing]
[flowing ][down]
[Someone ][left]
[the ][cake ][out]
[in ][the ][rain]
[I ][don't ][think]
[that ][I ][can ][take ][it]
[Cause ][it ][took ][so ][long]
[to ][bake ][it]
[And ][I'll ][never ][have]
[that ][recipe ][again,]
[oh ][no]
[I ][still ][see]
[the ][yellow]
[cotton ][dress]
[Foaming ][like ][a ][wave]
[on ][the ][ground]
[Around ][your ][knees]
[And ][the ][birds]
[like ][tender ][babies]
[on ][your ][hands]
[And ][the ][old ][men]
[are ][playing]
[Playing ][chequers]
[by ][the ][trees]
[MacArthur]
[Park ][is ][melting]
[in ][the ][dark]
[All ][the ][sweet,]
[green ][icing]
[flowing ][down]
[Someone ][left]
[the ][cake ][out]
[in ][the ][rain]
[I ][don't ][think]
[that ][I ][can ][take ][it]
[Cause ][it ][took ][so ][long]
[to ][bake ][it]
[And ][I'll ][never ][have]
[that ][recipe ][again,]
[oh ][no]
[~~~]
[There ][would ][be]
[another ][song ][for ][me]
[For ][I ][will ][sing ][it]
[There ][would ][be]
[another ][dream ][for ][me]
[Someone ][will ][bring ][it]
[Oh, ][I ][will]
[drink ][the ][wine]
[while ][it's ][warm]
[And ][never ][let ][you]
[catch ][me ][looking]
[at ][the ][sun]
[But ][after ][all]
[the ][loves ][of ][my ][life]
[After ][all]
[the ][loves ][of ][my ][life]
[You'll]
[still ][be ][the ][one]
[I ][would ][take ][my ][life]
[into ][my ][hands]
[And ][I ][will ][use ][it]
[I ][will ][win]
[the ][worship]
[in ][their ][eyes]
[And ][I ][will ][lose ][it]
[I ][will ][have]
[all ][the ][things]
[that ][I ][desire]
[And ][my ][passions ][flow]
[like ][rivers]
[in ][the ][sky]
[And ][after ][all]
[the ][loves ][of ][my ][life]
[Oh, ][after ][all]
[the ][loves ][of ][my ][life]
[You're ][still]
[gonna ][be ][the ][one]
[And ][wanna ][know ][why]
[MacArthur]
[Park ][is ][melting]
[in ][the ][dark]
[All ][the ][sweet,]
[green ][icing]
[flowing ][down]
[Someone ][left]
[the ][cake ][out]
[in ][the ][rain]
[I ][don't ][think]
[that ][I ][can ][take ][it]
[Cause ][it ][took ][so ][long]
[to ][bake ][it]
[And ][I'll ][never ][have]
[that ][recipe ][again,]
[oh ][no]
[Oh ][no]
