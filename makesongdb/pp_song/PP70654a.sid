[What ][happened ][here ][as]
[the ][New ][York ][sunset]
[disappeared]
[I ][found ][an ][empty]
[garden ][among ][the ][flag]
[stones ][there]
[Who ][lived ][here]
[He ][must ][have ][been ][a]
[gardener ][that ][cared ][a]
[lot ][who ][weeded ][out]
[the ][tears ][and ][grew ][a]
[good ][crop]
[Now ][it ][all ][looks]
[strange]
[It's ][funny ][how ][one]
[insect ][can ][damage ][so]
[much ][grain]
[And ][what's ][it ][for ][this]
[little ][empty ][garden ][by]
[the ][brownstone ][door]
[And ][the ][cracks]
[along ][the ][sidewalk]
[nothing ][grows ][no ][more]
[Who ][lived ][here]
[He ][must ][have ][been ][a]
[gardener ][that ][cared ][a]
[lot ][who ][weeded ][out]
[the ][tears ][and ][grew ][a]
[good ][crop]
[And ][we ][are ][so ][amazed]
[we're ][crippled ][and]
[we're ][dazed]
[A ][gardener ][like ][that]
[one ][no ][one ][can]
[replace]
[And ][I've ][been]
[knocking ][but ][no ][one]
[answers]
[And ][I've ][been]
[knocking ][most ][all ][the]
[day]
[Oh ][and ][I've ][been]
[calling]
[oh ][hey ][hey ][Johnny]
[can't ][you ][come ][out ][to]
[play]
[And ][through ][their]
[tears ][some ][say ][he]
[farmed ][his ][best ][in]
[younger ][years]
[But ][he'd ][have ][said]
[the ][root ][grows]
[stronger]
[If ][only ][he ][could ][hear]
[Who ][lived ][there]
[He ][must ][have ][been ][a]
[gardener ][that ][cared ][a]
[lot ][who ][weeded ][out]
[the ][tears ][and ][grew ][a]
[good ][crop]
[Now ][we ][pray ][for ][rain]
[And ][with ][every ][drop]
[that ][pours ][we ][hear ][we]
[hear ][your ][name]
[And ][I've ][been ][knocking]
[but ][no ][one ][answers]
[And ][I've ][been ][knocking]
[most ][all ][the ][day]
[Oh ][and ][I've ][been]
[calling]
[oh ][hey ][hey ][Johnny]
[can't ][you ][come ][out ][to]
[play]
[And ][I've ][been ][knocking]
[but ][no ][one ][answers]
[And ][I've ][been ][knocking]
[most ][all ][the ][day]
[Oh ][and ][I've ][been]
[calling]
[oh ][hey ][hey ][Johnny]
[can't ][you ][come ][out]
[can't ][you ][come ][out ][to]
[play]
[Johnny ][can't ][you ][come]
[out ][to ][play ][in ][your]
[empty ][garden]
[Johnny ][can't ][you ][come]
[out ][to ][play ][in ][your]
[empty ][garden]
[Johnny ][can't ][you ][come]
[out ][to ][play ][in ][your]
[empty ][garden]
[Johnny ][can't ][you ][come]
[out ][to ][play ][in ][your]
[empty ][garden]
