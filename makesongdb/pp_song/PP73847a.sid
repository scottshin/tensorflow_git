[I HEARD ][THE ][SOUND]
[OF ][MY ][DEAR]
[OLD ][MAMA ][CRYIN']
[AND ][THE ][SOUND]
[OF ][THE ][TRAIN]
[THAT ][TOOK ][ME]
[OFF ][TO ][WAR]
[AND ][THE ][AWFUL ][SOUND]
[OF ][A THOUSAND]
[BOMBS ][EXPLODING]
[AND ][I WONDERED]
[IF ][I COULD ][TAKE ][IT]
[ANYMORE]
[THERE ][WERE ][TIMES]
[WHEN ][THEY ][ALMOST]
[DROVE ][ME ][CRAZY]
[BUT ][I DID ][MY ][BEST]
[I TOOK ][IT ][LIKE ][A MAN]
[BUT ][WHO ][WOULD ][THINK]
[IN ][MY ][LONELY ][ROOM]
[I'D ][HEAR ][IT]
[THE ][ONE ][SOUND]
[IN ][THE ][WORLD]
[MY ][HEART ][CAN'T ][STAND]
[TO ][HEAR ][THAT ][SOUND]
[AND ][TO ][KNOW]
[IT'S ][REALLY ][OVER]
[THROUGH ][TEAR]
[STAINED ][EYES]
[I WATCHED ][HER]
[WALK ][AWAY]
[AND ][OF ][EARTHQUAKES]
[STORMS ][AND ][GUNS]
[AND ][WARS]
[LORD ][NOTHING]
[HAS ][EVER]
[HURT ][ME ][MORE]
[THAN ][THAT ][LONELY ][SOUND]
[THE ][CLOSING]
[OF ][THE ][DOOR]
[AND ][OF ][EARTHQUAKES]
[STORMS ][AND ][GUNS]
[AND ][WARS]
[LORD ][NOTHING]
[HAS ][EVER]
[HURT ][ME ][MORE]
[THAN ][THAT ][LONELY ][SOUND]
[THE ][CLOSING]
[OF ][THE ][DOOR]
