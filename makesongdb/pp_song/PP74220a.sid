[I realize ][the ][way ][your]
[eyes ][deceived ][me]
[with ][tender ][looks ][that]
[I mistook ][for ][love]
[So ][take ][away]
[the ][flowers]
[that ][you ][gave ][me]
[And ][send ][the ][kindness]
[that ][remind ][me ][of]
[Paper ][ROSES]
[Paper ][ROSES]
[Oh ][how ][beautiful]
[they ][seemed ][to ][be]
[But ][they're ][only]
[imitation]
[like ][you ][imitate]
[your ][love ][for ][me]
[I thought ][that ][you]
[would ][be ][a]
[perfect ][lover]
[You ][seemed ][so ][full ][of]
[sweetness ][at ][the ][start]
[But ][like ][the ][sweet ][red]
[roses ][made ][of ][paper]
[There ][is ][no ][steady]
[sweetness]
[in ][your ][heart]
[Paper ][ROSES]
[Paper ][ROSES]
[Oh ][how ][beautiful]
[they ][seemed ][to ][be]
[But ][they're ][only]
[imitation]
[like ][you ][imitate]
[your ][love ][for ][me]
