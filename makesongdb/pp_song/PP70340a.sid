[In ][the ][twilight]
[glow ][I ][see]
[Blue ][eyes ][crying]
[in ][the ][rain]
[When ][we ][kissed]
[goodbye]
[and ][party]
[And ][we'd ][never]
[meet ][again]
[Love ][is ][like]
[a ][dying ][ember]
[Darling ][never]
[let ][it ][rain]
[Through ][the ][ages]
[I'll ][remember]
[Blue ][eyes ][crying]
[in ][the ][rain]
[~~~]
[Blue ][eyes ][crying]
[in ][the ][rain]
[Someday ][when]
[we ][meet ][out ][yonder]
[We'll ][stroll ][hand]
[in ][hand ][again]
[In ][the ][land ][that]
[knows ][no ][parting]
[Blue ][eyes ][crying]
[in ][the ][rain]
