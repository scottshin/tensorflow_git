 I won't last 
a day without you


Paul Williams

[Day ][after ][day]
[I must ][face ][a world]
[of ][strangers]
[where ][I don't ][be ][long]
[I'm ][not ][that ][strong]
[it's ][nice ][to ][know]
[that ][there's ][someone]
[I can ][turn ][to]
[who ][will ][always ][care]
[you're ][always ][there]
[When ][there's ][no]
[getting ][over]
[that ][rainbow]
[when ][my ][smallest]
[of ][dreams ][won't]
[come ][true]
[I can ][take]
[all ][the ][madness]
[the ][world ][have ][to ][give]
[but ][I won't]
[last ][a day]
[without ][you]
[So ][many ][times]
[when ][the ][city ][seems]
[to ][be ][with ][out ][a]
[friendly ][face]
[a lonely ][place]
[it's ][nice ][to ][know]
[that ][you'll ][be ][there]
[if ][I need ][you]
[and ][you'll]
[always ][smile]
[it's ][all ][worth ][while]
[When ][there's ][no]
[getting ][over]
[that ][rainbow]
[when ][my ][smallest]
[of ][dreams ][won't]
[come ][true]
[I can ][take]
[all ][the ][madness]
[the ][world ][have ][to ][give]
[but ][I won't]
[last ][a day]
[without ][you]
[Touch ][me]
[and ][I end ][up ][singing]
[troubles ][seem ][to]
[up ][and ][disappear]
[you ][touch ][me]
[with ][the ][love]
[you're ][bringing]
[I can ][really ][lose]
[when ][you're ][near]
[my]
[love ][if ][all]
[my ][friends]
[have ][forgotten]
[half ][their ][promises]
[they're ][not ][unkind]
[just ][hard ][to ][find]
[One ][look ][at ][you ][and ][I]
[know ][that]
[I could ][learn]
[to ][live ][without]
[the ][rest]
[I found ][the ][best]
[When ][there's]
[no ][getting]
[over ][that ][rainbow]
[when ][my ][smallest]
[of ][dreams ][won't]
[come ][true]
[I can ][take]
[all ][the ][madness]
[the ][world ][have ][to ][give]
[but ][I won't]
[last ][a day]
[without ][you]
[When ][there's]
[no ][getting]
[over ][that ][rainbow]
[when ][my ][smallest]
[of ][dreams ][won't]
[come ][true]
[I can ][take]
[all ][the ][madness]
[the ][world ][have ][to ][give]
[but ][I won't]
[last ][a day]
[without ][you]
