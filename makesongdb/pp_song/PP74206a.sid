Yvonne Elliman

[I don't ][know]
[how ][to ][love ][him]
[What ][to ][do ][how ][to]
[move ][him]
[I've ][been ][changed]
[yes ][really ][changed]
[In ][these ][past ][few ][days]
[when ][I've ][seen ][myself]
[I seem ][like]
[someone ][else]
[I don't ][know]
[how ][to ][take ][this]
[I don't ][see]
[why ][he ][moves ][me]
[He's ][a man]
[he's ][just ][a man]
[And ][I've ][had ][so ][many]
[men ][before]
[in ][very ][many ][ways]
[He's ][just ][one ][more]
[Should ][I bring ][him ][down]
[should ][I]
[scream ][and ][shout]
[Should ][I speak ][of ][love]
[let ][my ][feelings ][out]
[I never ][throught]
[I'd ][come ][to ][this]
[what's ][it ][all ][about]
[Don't ][you ][think]
[it's ][rather ][funny]
[I should ][be]
[in ][this ][position]
[I'm ][the ][one]
[who's ][always ][been]
[So ][calm ][so ][cool]
[no ][lover's ][fool]
[Running ][every ][show]
[He ][scares ][me ][so]
[I never ][throught]
[I'd ][come ][to ][this]
[what's ][it ][all ][about]
[Yet ][If ][he ][said]
[he ][loved ][me]
[I'd ][be ][lost]
[I'd ][be ][frightened]
[I couldn't ][cope]
[just ][couldn't ][cope]
[I'd ][turn ][my ][head]
[I'd ][back ][away]
[I wouldn't ][want ][to ][know]
[He ][scares ][me ][so]
[I want ][him ][so]
[I love ][him ][so]
