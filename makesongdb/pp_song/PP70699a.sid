[WE ][WALKED]
[TO ][THE ][SEA]
[JUST ][MY ][FATHER]
[AND ][ME]
[AND ][THE ][DOGS ][PLAYED]
[AROUND ][ON ][THE ][SAND]
[WINTER ][COLD]
[CUT ][THE ][AIR ][HANGIN']
[STILL ][EVERYWHERE]
[DRESSED ][IN ][GRAY]
[DID ][HE ][SAY]
["HOLD ][MY ][HAND"?]
[I ][SAID ][LOVE'S]
[EASIER ][WHEN]
[IT'S ][FAR ][AWAY]
[WE ][SAT ][AND]
[WATCHED ][A]
[DISTANT ][LIGHT]
[WE'RE ][TWO ][SHIPS]
[THAT ][PASS]
[IN ][THE ][NIGHT]
[WE ][BOTH ][SMILE]
[AND ][WE ][SAY]
[IT'S ][ALRIGHT]
[WE'RE ][STILL ][HERE]
[IT'S ][JUST ][THAT]
[WE'RE ][OUT ][OF ][SIGHT]
[LIKE ][THOSE ][SHIPS]
[THAT ][PASS]
[IN ][THE ][NIGHT]
[THERE'S ][A ][BOAT]
[ON ][THE ][LINE]
[WHERE ][THE ][SEA]
[MEETS ][THE ][SKY]
[THERE'S ][ANOTHER]
[THAT ][RIDES]
[FAR ][BEHIND]
[AND ][IT ][SEEMS]
[YOU ][AND ][I ][ARE]
[LIKE ][STRANGERS]
[A ][WIDE ][WAYS ][APART]
[AS ][WE ][DRIFT]
[ON ][THROUGH ][TIME]
[HE ][SAID]
[IT'S ][HARDER ][NOW]
[WE'RE ][FAR ][AWAY]
[WE ][ONLY ][READ ][YOU]
[WHEN ][YOU ][WRITE]
[WE'RE ][TWO ][SHIPS]
[THAT ][PASS]
[IN ][THE ][NIGHT]
[AND ][WE ][SMILE]
[WHEN ][WE ][SAY]
[IT'S ][ALRIGHT]
[WE'RE ][STILL ][HERE]
[IT'S ][JUST ][THAT]
[WE'RE ][OUT ][OF ][SIGHT]
[LIKE ][THOSE ][SHIPS]
[THAT ][PASS]
[IN ][THE ][NIGHT]
[WE'RE ][JUST ][SHIPS]
[THAT ][PASS]
[IN ][THE ][NIGHT]
[AND ][WE ][SMILE]
[WHEN ][WE ][SAY]
[IT'S ][ALRIGHT]
[WE'RE ][STILL ][HERE]
[IT'S ][JUST ][THAT]
[WE'RE ][OUT ][OF ][SIGHT]
[LIKE ][THOSE ][SHIPS]
[THAT ][PASS]
[IN ][THE ][NIGHT]
[THAT ][PASS]
[IN ][THE ][NIGHT]
