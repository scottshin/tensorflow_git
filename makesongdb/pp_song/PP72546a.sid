[Why ][try? ][I ][know ][why]
[This ][feeling ][inside]

[It's ][time ][I ][was ][king]
[now, ][not ][just]
[one ][more ][pawn]
[Fly ][by ][night]
[away ][from ][here]
[Change ][my ][life ][again]
[Fly ][by ][night,]
[goodbye, ][my ][dear]
[My ][ship ][isn't ][coming]
[and ][I ][just]
[can't ][pretend]
[Moonrise;]
[thoughtful ][eyes]
[staring ][back ][at ][me]
[from ][the]
[window ][beside]
[No ][fright]
[or ][hindsight]
[leaving ][behind ][that]
[empty ][feeling ][inside]
[Fly ][by ][night]
[away ][from ][here]
[Change ][my ][life ][again]
[Fly ][by ][night,]
[goodbye, ][my ][dear]
[My ][ship ][isn't ][coming]
[and ][I ][just]
[can't ][pretend]
[wow!]
