Lionel Richie

[Lady, ][morning's]
[just ][a ][moment ][away]
[and ][I'm ][without]
[you ][once ][again]
[You ][laughed ][at ][me]
[you ][said ][you've]
[never ][needed ][me;]
[I ][wonder ][if]
[you ][need ][me ][now]
[So ][many ][dreams]
[that ][flew ][away]
[So ][many ][words]
[we ][didn't ][say]
[Two ][people]
[lost ][in ][a ][storm;]
[where ][did ][we ][go,]
[where'd ][we ][go?]
[Lost ][what ][we]
[both ][had ][found]
[You ][know,]
[we ][let ][each]
[other ][down]
[But ][then ][most ][of ][all]
[I ][do ][love ][you ][still]
[We ][played ][the]
[games ][that]
[people ][play]
[We ][made ][our]
[mistakes]
[along ][the ][way]
[Somehow ][I ][know]
[deep ][in ][my ][heart]
[you ][needed ][me]
['cause ][I ][needed]
[you ][so ][desp'rately;]
[we ][were ][too]
[blind ][to ][see]
[But ][then ][most ][of ][all]
[I ][do ][love ][you ][still]
