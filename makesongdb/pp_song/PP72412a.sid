[WELL, ][I ][WOKE ][UP]
[SUNDAY ][MORNING,]
[WITH ][NO ][WAY]
[TO ][HOLD ][MY ][HEAD,]
[THAT ][DIDN'T ][HURT]
[AND ][THE ][BEER]
[I ][HAD ][FOR ][BREAKFAST,]
[WASN'T ][BAD, ][SO]
[I ][HAD ][ONE ][MORE]
[FOR ][DESSERT ][THEN]
[I ][THUMBLED ][THROUGH]
[MY ][CLOSET,]
[FOR ][MY ][CLOTHES,]
[FOUND ][MY ][CLEANEST,]
[DIRTY ][SHIRT ][THEN]
[I ][WASHED ][MY ][FACE]
[AND ][COMBED ][MY ][HAIR,]
[STUMBLED ][DOWN ][THE]
[STAIRS ][TO ][MEET ][THE ][DAY]
[I ][SMOKED ][MY]
[BRAIN ][THE ][NIGHT ][BEFORE,]
[WITH ][CIGARETTES ][AND]
[SONGS ][WE ][BEEN ][PICKING]
[AND ][I ][LIT ][MY ][FIRST]
[AND ][STOPPED ][TO ][WATCH,]
[A]
[SMALL ][KID ][WITH]
[A ][CAN ][THAT]
[HE ][WAS ][KICKING]
[THEN ][I ][CROSSED]
[AN ][EMPTY ][STREET,]
[AND ][CAUGHT ][THE]
[SUNDAY ][SMELL ][OF]
[SOMEONE ][FRYING]
[CHICKEN]
[AND ][THEN ][IT]
[TOOK ][ME ][BACK]
[TO ][SOMETHING, ][THAT]
[I ][LOST, ][SOMEWHERE,]
[SOMEHOW ][ALONG ][THE]
[WAY ][ON ][A]
[SUNDAY ][MORNING]
[SIDEWALK,]
[WISHING ][LORD ][THAT]
[I ][WAS ][STONED]
[CAUSE ][THERE'S ][SOMETHING]
[IN ][A ][SUNDAY,]
[THAT ][MAKES ][SOMEBODY]
[FEEL ][ALONE ][AND]
[IT'S ][NOTHING ][SURE]
[BUT ][DYING, ][HALF]
[AS ][LONESOME ][AS]
[THE ][SOUND ][OF]
[A ][SLEEPING ][CITY]
[SIDEWALK, ][WHEN]
[SUNDAY]
[MORNING ][COMING]
[DOWN]
[IN ][A ][PARK]
[I ][SAW ][A]
[DADDY, ][WITH ][A]
[LAUGHING ][LITTLE ][GIRL,]
[HE ][WAS ][SWINGING]
[AND ][I ][STOPPED]
[BESIDE ][A ][SUNDAY]
[SCHOOL, ][AND ][LISTENED]
[TO ][THE ][SONGS,]
[THEY ][WERE ][SINGING]
[THEN ][I ][HEADED]
[BACK ][FOR ][HOME,]
[AND ][SOMEWHERE ][FAR]
[AWAY ][A ][LONELY]
[BELL ][WAS ][RINGING]
[AND ][IT ][ECHOED]
[TO ][THE ][CANYONS,]
[LIKE ][THE ][DISAPPEARING]
[DREAMS ][OF ][YESTERDAY]
[ON ][A ][SUNDAY]
[MORNING ][SIDEWALK,]
[WISHING]
[LORD ][THAT ][I]
[WAS ][STONED]
[CAUSE ][THERE'S ][SOMETHING]
[IN ][A ][SUNDAY,]
[THAT ][MAKES ][SOMEBODY]
[FEEL ][ALONE]
[AND ][IT'S ][NOTHING]
[SURE ][BUT ][DYING,]
[HALF ][AS ][LONESOME]
[AS ][THE ][SOUND ][OF]
[A ][SLEEPING ][CITY]
[SIDEWALK,]
[WHEN ][SUNDAY ][MORNING]
[COMING ][DOWN]
