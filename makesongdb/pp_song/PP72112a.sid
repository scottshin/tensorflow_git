AL STEWART

[On ][a ][morning ][from]
[a ][Bogart ][movie]
[in ][a ][country ][where]
[they ][turned ][back ][time]
[you ][go ][strolling]
[through ][the ][crowd ][like]
[Peter ][Lorre]
[contemplating ][a ][crime]
[She ][comes ][out ][of ][the]
[sun ][in ][a ][silk ][dress]
[running ][like ][a ][water~]
[color ][in ][the ][rain]
[Don't ][bother ][asking]
[for ][explanations]
[She'll ][just ][tell ][you]
[that ][she ][came]
[in ][the ][Year]
[of ][the ][Cat]
[She ][doesn't ][give ][you]
[time ][for ][questions]
[as ][she ][locks ][up]
[your ][arms ][in ][hers]
[And ][you ][follow]
[till ][your ][sense]
[of ][which ][direction]
[completely ][disappears]
[By ][the ][blue]
[tiled ][walls]
[near ][the]
[market ][stalls]
[there's ][a ][hidden ][door]
[she ][leads ][you ][to]
["These ][days" ][she ][says,]
["I ][feel ][my ][life]
[just ][like ][a ][river]
[running ][through]
[the ][Year]
[of ][the ][Cat"]
[Well, ][she ][looks ][at]
[you ][so ][cooly]
[and ][her]
[eyes ][shine]
[like ][the ][moon]
[in ][the ][sea]
[She ][comes ][in ][incense]
[and ][patchouli]
[so ][you ][take ][her]
[to ][find ][what's]
[waiting ][inside]
[the ][Year ][of ][the ][Cat]
[The ][morning ][comes ][and]
[you're ][still ][with ][her]
[and ][the ][bus ][and ][the]
[tourists ][are ][gone]
[and ][you've ][thrown]
[away ][your ][choice]
[and ][lost ][your ][ticket]
[so ][you ][have ][to ][stay ][on]
[But ][the ][drum]
[beat ][strains]
[of ][the ][night]
[remain]
[in ][the ][rhythm ][of]
[a ][newborn ][day]
[You ][know]
[some ][time]
[you're ][bound]
[to ][leave ][her]
[but ][for ][now]
[you're ][gonna ][stay]
[in ][the ][Year ][of ][the ][Cat]
[mmm]
[Year ][of ][the ][Cat]
