[Those ][happy ][hours]
[that ][we ][once ][knew]
[Though ][long ][ago]
[still ][make ][me ][blue]
[They ][say ][that ][time]
[heals ][a ][broken ][heart]
[But ][time ][has ][stood]
[still]
[since ][we've]
[been ][apart]
[I ][can't ][stop]
[loving ][you]
[I've ][made ][up]
[my ][mind]
[To ][live ][in ][memory]
[of ][old ][lonesome ][times]
[I ][can't ][stop]
[wanting ][you]
[It's ][useless ][to ][say]
[so ][I'll ][just ][live]
[my ][life ][in ][dreams]
[of ][yesterday]
[Those ][happy ][hours]
[that ][we ][once ][knew]
[Though ][long ][ago]
[still ][make ][me ][blue]
[They ][say ][that ][time]
[heals ][a ][broken ][heart]
[But ][time ][has]
[stood ][still]
[since ][we've]
[been ][apart]
[I ][can't ][stop]
[loving ][you]
[there's ][no ][use ][to ][try]
[pretend ][there's]
[someone ][new]
[I ][can't ][live ][a ][lie]
[I ][can't ][stop]
[wanting ][you]
[the ][way ][that ][I ][do]
[There's ][only ][been]
[one ][love ][for ][me ][that]
[one ][love ][is ][you]
