[ALONE ][AND]
[MISUNDERSTOOD]
[THAT'S WHY]
[I CAME ][TO YOU]
[THE FEELINGS]
[I HAVE ][INSIDE]
[WITH YOU ][I CANT ][HIDE]
[I SEE ][THAT LIFES ][A GAME]
[GET HURT]
[BUT WHOS ][TO BLAME]
[I GUESS ][IM JUST ][A CHILD]
[IN A ][WORLD]
[THAT'S VERY ][WILD]
[WHERE CAN ][I FIND]
[A PLACE]
[THAT'S FULL ][OF]
[TENDERNESS]
[I GET ][THERE]
[WHEN I ][CLOSE MY ][EYES]
[AND HOLD ][AND PRAY]
[THAT YOU ][AND I]
[WILL BE ][THERE]
[SOMEDAY ][I SAY]
[WELL MAKE]
[A BRIGHTER ][DAY]
[BETTER ][THAN]
[OUR YESTERDAY]
[SOMEDAY ][I SAY]
[WELL MAKE]
[A BRIGHTER ][DAY]
[BUT TODAYS ][OUR CHANCE]
[TO BE ][HERE]
[IS THERE]
[A ROOM ][FOR CHANGE]
[THERE ARE ][THINGS]
[TO REARRANGE]
[I THOUGHT ][THAT]
[WE ARE ][YOUNG]
[AND TEMPTATIONS]
[ARE STRONG]
[BUT IVE ][GOT]
[TO START ][WITH ME]
[IT'S HARD ][BUT LET ][IT BE]
[IT MAY ][TAKE SOME ][TIME]
[FIXING ][UP]
[A PERFECT ][LIFE]
[WHERE CAN ][I FIND ][A PLACE]
[THATS FULL ][OF]
[TENDERNESS]
[I GET ][THERE]
[WHEN I ][CLOSE MY ][EYES]
[AND HOLD ][AND PRAY]
[THAT YOU ][AND I]
[WILL BE ][THERE]
[SOMEDAY ][I SAY]
[WELL MAKE]
[A BRIGHTER ][DAY]
[BETTER ][THAN]
[OUR YESTERDAY]
[SOMEDAY ][I SAY]
[WELL MAKE]
[A BRIGHTER ][DAY]
[BUT TODAYS ][OUR CHANCE]
[TO BE ][HERE]
[ONCE IN ][A WHILE]
[YOU GET ][DOWN]
[AND GET ][WILD]
[SET THE ][RAIN HOPE ][SO]
[I TOOK ][SOME DOPE]
[WHAT HAPPENED]
[TO YOUR ][START]
[NOT A ][DUMB OLD ][FUN]
[I HAD ][RENEWED MY ][FAITH]
[BETTER ][NOT BE ][LATE]
[CAUSE I ][HATE]
[TO GO ][BACK AGAIN]
[WASTING MY ][LIFE AND ][SIN]
[I GOT ][MY LORD]
[TO OBEY ][NOW]
[SO I ][SAY NOW]
[TAKE A ][RIDE HOME ][GO]
[TAKE A ][RIDE HOME ][GO]
[BACK TO ][THE FATHER]
[SOMEDAY ][I SAY]
[WELL MAKE]
[A BRIGHTER ][DAY]
[BETTER ][THAN]
[OUR YESTERDAY]
[SOMEDAY ][I SAY]
[WELL MAKE]
[A BRIGHTER ][DAY]
[BUT TODAYS ][OUR CHANCE]
[TO BE ][HERE]
[TODAYS ][OUR CHANCE]
[TO BE ][HERE]
[WELL MAKE]
[A BRIGHTER ][DAY]
[BUT TODAYS ][OUR CHANCE]
[TO BE ][HERE]
